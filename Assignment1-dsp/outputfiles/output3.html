<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">It worked well. However, a user of this product should be careful to inspect all crevices of the product if such a user wants to ensure that they fully clean the product because simply washing it under a sink may not remove all sticky pieces.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GRYCY2LQIFB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GRYCY2LQIFB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">This product works fine, it is just that the design slices the bananas too thick for cereal or fruit salads which is what I use sliced bananas for mostly.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">The Banana Slicer is the sort of thing that one thinks is for people too lazy to cut up a banana, but my husband is a gadget fan so I got it for him and now I love it myself because one motion produces UNIFORM slices which is very helpful when baking or decorating something.Nice to have and not expensive.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYWDMWUM7UP4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYWDMWUM7UP4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I love all these random reviews, but I can honestly say I like this product. Yes, the slices are a little big, but I have no problem with that whatsoever.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Bought this for $99 before they dropped the price (I KNOW, early adopter syndrome ugh). Just a heads up, there is NO backwards compatibility between the H-571 or earlier models.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Although my review does list quite a few flaws, this is a great little gadget. It does have a few things that could be improved on. The slices are a little thicker than I would normally cut myself. Only one side of the slicer is meant for cutting, and it's not always the correct side that matches the curvature of the banana. When you press down on a banana, it usually doesn't go all the way through, so you have to flip it over and push each banana piece through. And lastly, it's hard to clean out the little nooks and crannies.All that being said, none of those are major, and it is still very handy to have.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DI8C96Y6WSC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DI8C96Y6WSC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">For years, there has been this lack of motivation in my life.Then i woke up this morning, feeling sluggish as usual, i slowly walked down the stairs dragging ass if i might say. I got to the mailbox this large brown envelope  to my shock was in my mailbox, what could it be i thought to myself. I opened this envelope to find this yellow item made of plastic .... What could this be for... Then i read the most pleasing words my eyes have ever seen "banana slicer".HOLY S***! I ran to the kitchen, whipped out my box of bananas (i keep them handy for potassium emergencies) i sliced away for hours! Despite the blisters on my finger tips my phalanges were enthused beyond belief! I have never felt more excitement in my entire life! Who made this i thought to myself! The person MUST make more money then Bill Gates! If not then that is preposterous!If you do not own a banana slicer, buy one ASAP! I am a brand new woman i get up every morning and rush down the stairs to make sure my banana slicer is safe and sound! Then we bond for hours slicing away!  I named him MR WONDERFUL!New found woman in ohio & mr wonderful.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SY8NQQGGA550/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SY8NQQGGA550/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Bill:PERSON, 	-Gates:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">My favorite thing about this item is the top comments, I'm not gonna lie.. But it is every bit of wonderful in the kitchen. Not only do I believe that it is a useful, cute yellow thing to have in my kitchen but it works perfectly. It would have gotten 5 stars if most of the banana slices didn't have to be poked off the Hutzler 571.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">This product is a work of art. nothing slices a banana better than the Hutzler 571. In fact it is so great that the legendary Woody Hayes used this product to slice his nanners for his Buckeyes as the won national title after national title. rumor has it, his assistant coach bo schumsuckler was so opposed to the awesomeness that was the Hutzler 571 he left the storied collegiate powerhouse that is The Ohio State University and headed north to university of something. without the greatness that is the Hutzler 571 Slicer by his side and in the locker room, his streak of national titles he won with Buckeyes came to a screeching halt and he never won a national championship again. oh, and up yours Robert Marienfeld. You suck</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IJ3IM70WWMFF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IJ3IM70WWMFF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Woody:PERSON, 	-Hayes:PERSON, 	-Buckeyes:ORGANIZATION, 	-bo:PERSON, 	-schumsuckler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Ohio:ORGANIZATION, 	-State:ORGANIZATION, 	-University:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Buckeyes:ORGANIZATION, 	-Robert:PERSON, 	-Marienfeld:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I opted for the 5 pack since I typically buy bananas in bunches, 5 to be exact. Although... I didn't account for my ritual of smashing and eating at least 1 banana on the drive home from the grocery store. I called my sponsor and he was able to talk me through the drive home..I studied the 3 sentence manual for a good 45 minutes before deciding to take this bad boys for a spin. I decided to use rubber gloves, as the manual recommended for novices and laid my bananas on a cutting board. Much to my disappointment, I realized I simply could not use all 5 banana slicers at once. I used my two hands of course, because they were available. I then found an old stool in the garage that I sat on and lifted my legs outward, very monkey like. Soon I was able balance and was easily able to use my two feet to grip the well shaped Hutzler 571.This is when things went from normal to a little weird. Clearly I only had one body part left that was long enough and study enough to maintain a firm grip on the Hutzler 571; since my wife already described it as banana shaped, I figured, what the heck? What's the worst thing that can happen? Well, let's just say the last woman to go near me was the Chiquita banana woman.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIE6EPQY5ALC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIE6EPQY5ALC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Chiquita:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">If ever a product was misnamed, this is certainly the one. The question is: was this intentionally done by the Hutzler people or are they just completely ignorant to history? Let me provide some background. Like a majority of American baby-boomer children, I grew up in a house that staunchly promoted the new post-war 5-5-3 banana cutting configuration. Of course, this refers to 5 small slices, 5 medium slices, and 3 slightly larger slices. This was developed in early-1947 as a direct repudiation of the 3-4-6 approach that was so favored by our grandparents’ generation, and had been in use since the early 1800s.  That arrangement  was created in the Russian shtetls to show the Tsar that, even though they were poor peasants, the people could still slice their bananas the way they wanted, and that they could have as many large pieces as they chose!  This turned out to be a largely symbolic gesture, though, as fresh bananas were quite rare in the 19th century Pale (and beyond).  Anyway, the 5-5-3 approach was a clean break (no pun intended) with the past. So when I saw the Hutzler 571 advertised, I assumed that this was the Millennials’ bid to take their rightful place in the banana-cutting saga.  “Finally”, I thought (using the proper mental quotes), “a generation that not only wants to leave its mark, but is doing so with a precision tool.”  Not wanting to be labeled an “old fogey”, I immediately placed an order for one.  It arrived at my door soon after, and I opened the package with trembling hands. I carefully placed it over my banana, and pressed down as instructed.  Then I stood back in horror. No! This cannot be. 1, 2, 3, 4…..18 slices!!!!  And all of about the same size.  I quickly checked the package.  Yes…it does say “Hutzler 571”. 571! 5-7-1. 13!  The ordained 13 of our ancestors.  Not 18. 13!  Hutzler: is this some sort of a scam?  Needless to say, I have returned this blasphemous product and will continue using my beloved 5-5-3 method by hand.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVT51J4MLF51/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVT51J4MLF51/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkGreen;">Purchased the Hutzler 571 as a birthday gift for a co-worker.  When the Hutzler 571 arrived, I was so excited....but, needed something more to round out this gift.  "I know", I said and rushed off to the grocery store....I entered the store with much trepidation, as I suddenly realized that this particular store may only sell left facing bananas.  I took a deep breath and proceded in....as I approached the produce section, I could hardly believe my eyes...there, right on top....the perfect bunch of right facing bananas.I purchased these beauties and took them home to individually wrap them, so I could present this gift in a gift bag, along with the Hutzler 571.  This gift was a huge hit.  That birthday turned into nothing but a banana slicing bonanza!!

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I've loved reading all the reviews of the banana slicer, but I thought I'd share with you maybe the one single instance that the product truly made someone's life better.  I work with developmentally disabled adults in a group home setting.  Our goal is to help make them as independent as possible, regardless of how small a feat "normal" folks perceived the task to be.  I have an elderly gentleman with moderate developmental disabilities, coupled with advanced cerebral palsy.  In spite of this, he tries very hard to be independent, but slicing bananas is just too much for him to accomplish on his own. When the posts for the banana slicer first hit facebook, I ordered one for him. He loves it because it's safe for him to use, and it gives him an opportunity to be involved in his own day.  He gleefully slices the bananas for his own breakfast and enough for his two housemates to enjoy.  Having said that, please carry on with the funny replies. I love reading them!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OVPHPJR0SCKH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OVPHPJR0SCKH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I normally don't write reviews on Banana Slicers, but coming from East Germany when there was still a Stalin Made Wall between us and freedom, I think perspective is needed.  See, in Soviet Germany, we have a saying, "Slice a Banana or be buried in a shallow grave as a traitor to our Soviet Overlords."  We tried for years to invent something to compete with the Western Germans and NATO, and even the USA using coat hangers and razor blades.  Crude but effective.  Unfortunately, razor blades were hard to come by in Soviet Germany so alternatives were needed.  We tried to use wire thinking this would be thin and durable but we found the wires would not stay in place causing the slices to be uneven and not to WESTERN standards.  So then we used welding equipment, Steel from the Ural Mountains, and the spirit of the Soviet Bear and came up with an Industrial slicer that was about 24 metric tons but worked like a Chopin Symphony.  We created almost 1,000,000 units of this slicer before the end of the cold war and we felt that we did everything possible to make our lives full and complete.  When I saw this slicer, I felt an urge to kill myself like no other.  Even when the Soviet KGB held me in a prison of pain for 5 years, I never felt like giving up like I did when I saw this device.  So simple, and light and perfect.  I have no desire to live anymore but I still gave the product 3 stars because its still amazing.  Now, heed my words and know that in some countries, we are not blessed with technology like this and for us, it breaks our spirit.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA10IJHAUX9X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA10IJHAUX9X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-East:LOCATION, 	-Germany:LOCATION, 	-Soviet:LOCATION, 	-Germany:LOCATION, 	-NATO:ORGANIZATION, 	-USA:LOCATION, 	-Soviet:LOCATION, 	-Germany:LOCATION, 	-Ural:LOCATION, 	-Mountains:LOCATION, 	-Chopin:ORGANIZATION, 	-Symphony:ORGANIZATION, 	-KGB:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">In the beginning, there was hunger and misery. Life was short and brutal for the  primates in the savanna, easy prey for the swifter animals, and the little band appeared near extinction. But one bold creature picked up a  slightly flattened rock, and the Hutzler #1 was born! Far from perfect, this simple prototype was primarily used for cracking open  bones for marrow, but it was a start! Generation after generation began to thrive and expand, due to the  advantages afforded them by the Hutzler #1, and gradually improvements began to be made. Hutzler #7 was best used for smashing the skulls of rival primates, #42 for slicing raisins, #111 for trimming nose hair. Hutzler 352 carved decorative figurines out of casaba melons. Some saw that as a setback, but NO! Each and every Hutzler evolution was a breakthrough, not only in technology but in imagination, they all represented  drive in the indomitable spirit that makes a man a MAN! The Miracle Push Up Wonder Hutzler, the Steamed Coffee Hutzler, the Revolving Mirrored Dance Club Hutzler, (# 389, 412, and 461, respectively). Then, the Hutzler that was to be the answer to all Hutzlers, the single greatest Hutzler ever to be seen by mere mortals! It gleamed so brightly it was hard to gaze upon, it seemed to have a form of energy pulsing through it, it was the Hutzler our race had been awaiting, the Hutzler that would make us one with the Gods themselves! IT WAS SOOOO BEAUTIFUL!!! With the Hutzler 571, THE WORLD IS NOW OURS!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1318N482171W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1318N482171W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I really like this. I am always in a rush in the morning and have to make 5-6 people breakfast. Bananas are always added or top our foods. This slides right down. It is big enough to do the bigger bananas. The only negative things I could say is, you have to pop the slices threw the slit all the way and washing is a tad bit of a pain. I always rinse mine right after I use it - my husband didn't the other morning and it had to be soaked to get the banana slime off.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZJRXYESADE31/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZJRXYESADE31/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Nowhere did it say you had to be a big banana to use this. Such a mean product, it perpetuates the anti-red banana agenda.

I would say more silly things but it looks like all the amazon reviews have that covered. In all SERIOUSNES folks, this is pretty cool and was totally worth it.

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">My new wife and I struggled this past year what with the economy down and both of us unemployed. We were not sure how we would be able to make it through the holidays with no money to spend on gifts for each other. We decided we would not buy gifts, but I love Christmas so much I just had to buy her something. My wife's favorite thing in the world is her Banana, she loves it almost as much as I love my trusty, but dull and rusty knife. I've always wanted to allow my wife to be able to slice and eat that banana but with my inadequate knife I could never satisfy her banana needs. I finally decided I would do what is necessary to get her the best gift this Christmas. So I did it...I sold my knife. With the money I was able to get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for her on Christmas Eve. On Christmas morning we woke up and I reached under the bed to retrieve my special gift for my wife, surprisingly she seemed to be doing the same thing. When I turned over I saw her holding a gift."You shouldn't have!" I said. "I had to..." she replied.We opened each others gifts and I was shocked to find in the box...a knife sharpener! When I looked up to tell her, I noticed tears in her eyes as she looked down at my gift. I asked her what was wrong."I sold my banana to buy you that knife sharpener.""But I sold my knife to buy you that banana slicer."We laughed and cried and this memory has kept us going through years of marriage.When we were finally able to buy another banana, my wife finally confessed, that she liked her bananas cut the other way in long strips. So they really need to add an attachment or make a new model if they want to get 5 stars.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJKXBJFUGM3UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJKXBJFUGM3UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">Great idea, but only so-so execution. Device has no indicator lights to let you know when cutting is complete.

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkGreen;">The reviews for this product are hilarious, but this is actually a useful product. I purchase about 20-25 pounds of bananas at a time for dehydration. Before purchasing the banana slicer, I just cut the bananas with a butter knife.  My slices would not all be the same thickness and would not dehydrate in the same amount of time. The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner. I prefer 1/4" slices for dehydrated bananas and these are about 1/2" thick.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N6DDXE8O8LJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1N6DDXE8O8LJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">i needed a banana slicer that would cut bananas quickly to a uniform thickness.  This one does the trick.  The slices are almost 1/2" thick which may be too thick for cereal or banana pudding but I needed 1/2" slices for my freeze dryer so it's perfect.  You must use it on a very flat surface to cut the slices all uniformly.

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">I give this product 3 stars, because it does slice bananas into uniformly thick slices (well, except for that one freakishly thick slice at the end).However, it has one fatal flaw: the slices just fall to the floor once you push the banana through from the top. Sure, as long as you pick them up in 5 seconds or less, who's the wiser? But who can gather up 18 banana slices in 5 seconds?? Maybe if Amazon can get legislation passed to increase the 5-second rule ceiling to something like, oh say 20 seconds, this would be a useable product. I really don't see both sides of the aisle in Congress coming together to avoid the 5-second cliff though.Or perhaps Amazon could package it with something that can catch the banana slices and keep them off the floor...like a table, or counter-top or something like that. Solve this issue and you're talking about a 5-star product here!Until then, I guess I'll just have to make the kids kneel on the floor and catch the banana slices in their mouths as they fall. Sure is difficult to get 18 kids into a group that small on the floor though....</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7TWAASEK807V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7TWAASEK807V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Congress:ORGANIZATION, 	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I assumed from the photos that this slicer would produce 18 uniform banana slices.  After slicing several bananas, I counted the resulting slices and found that the number of slices produced from a single round of slicing ranged from 12 to 16 slices.  I never got the 18 slices that I expected.  I had my wife try it and she got similar results.  I checked the number of blades, and consulted with a mathematician friend to confirm that the 17 blades should produce 18 slices.  Since I couldn't get it to work, I gave up on it and threw it in the drawer. Then one day asked my daughter to bring me a ruler and she brought me the banana slicer, thinking it was some sort of cool kitchen ruler.  That's when it occurred to me to measure some bananas, and lo-and-behold, bananas come in different sizes.  I measured each banana and counted the number of slices each one produced, and found that there was a strong positive correlation between the length of the banana and the number of slices produced.  Long story short, the ONLY way to get 18 slices is to start with a banana that is exactly the same length as the slicer.  You essentially have to take the thing with you to the supermarket to make sure you have the right size banana.And don't get me started on how two of the slices don't look anything like the other slices.  Somehow they end up being pointed on one side - even though all the blades are straight.  I've found this to be most problematic near the ends of the banana.  So if consistency is your goal, I don't think you're ever going to get 18 slices out of one banana from this unit.Additionally, this slicer works only in one direction.  You have to push the slicer DOWN on top of a banana that is situated on a flat surface.  If you want to slice in a different direction, you just end up pushing the banana off the table and wind up with a banana on the floor.  And if you put the banana on top of the slicer and try to slice by lifting, all you are left with are some small dents on the bottom of the banana.  If that happens to you, all is not lost. If you have a standard knife, you can flip the banana over (make sure you mark the top some way so you know you have flipped it all the way around) and use the indentations as a guide to cut pretty decent slices. This technique also comes in handy if you push the slicer only part of the way down and then lift it up again without cutting all the way through.  This can happen if you can't accurately judge the distance to the cutting board. (There really should be some sort of gauge to let you know you've sliced all the way through.)  Anyway, if you end up having to finish cutting your own slices, you avoid wasting a perfectly good banana, but then what was the point of spending the money on a dedicated banana slicer to begin with?So if all you are looking for is something that produces an unspecified number of slices of banana under very limited conditions, then this will probably work for you.  But be prepared for some frustration and a steep learning curve.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ELMETK2MQ668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ELMETK2MQ668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">Have you ever tried to slice a banana on an inter-galactic spaceship? I had to hide the embarrassing manual process--banana in hand, knife in the other, atop the galactic map counter, hacking away at it... I was a basket case until the human relations AI Balthazar ordered for me the Hutzler 571 Banana slicer. When the Amazon drone--what spectacle that was!--dropped in on the ship just before we went into FTL flight, my confidence, and thus standing with the crew changed dramatically. After consistent and systematic repeated use of the Hutzler banana slicer--the plastic held up beautifully during the wormhole passage--I was catapulted to ship's captain. I went from hiding with embarrassment in my dark, little bunk to sitting pretty in the captain's chair on the bridge. Like a god! To say nothing of the BIG cabin and fantastic glam uniform with lots of gold and ribbons. Now I face the galactic powers with confidence. When encounters get tough, I whip out my banana slicer and show those snooty Zdas with way too many beady eyes my prowess with the banana slicer. And they simply fold in whimpering terror..Balthazar, our AI, ordered banana slicers for everyone on the ship. And on planet Zycom. The excitement can hardly be contained as we wait for the Amazon drone to deliver. It has such pretty lights. (The drone, not the banana slicer.)</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJJAKDLS7ZKYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJJAKDLS7ZKYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Balthazar:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Zdas:LOCATION, 	-Balthazar:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">You other people jest, but after nearly cutting through my finger slicing a banana with a butter knife, I had to get this. It works perfectly.

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">For those that have complained about this only being for right-hand curved bananas, I've discovered a solution.Like you, for months I was frustrated about this problem. I found myself eating all the right-handed bananas in my cereal while the lefties sat and browned. I'd eventually cut them up with a regular old knife and throw them in some banana bread or make some pudding.I know this is going to sound a little crazy, but my solution came through an accident. One day, while I was washing the dishes, I wasn't paying attention and my arm brushed against the Hutzler 571. I knocked it to the ground below. (THANKFULLY IT FELL ON A PADDED RUG AND DIDN'T BREAK. I MEAN, THEY ARE DURABLE, BUT WHAT A MOMENT OF PANIC!)I still can't explain it, but after it hit the ground, somehow the jarring motion switched it over. All of a sudden, I had a left-handed slicer. I immediately called my wife and when she got home, we each had 2 bowls of cereal, all with perfectly cut slices of our LEFT-HANDED bananas.Of course, then I had the same problem with all my right-handed bananas. I decided to try it again. (This time making sure it landed on the rug.) It didn't work. I was crushed, but something inside me said try again. I did. Still nothing. I tossed and turned all night.The next morning, this voice kept telling me to try the rug one more time. It was relentless. I couldn't give up.That third time, I still can't believe it, the slicer switched back to right-handed.I wondered if something supernatural had happened. But all my friends and family that I've bought these for have tried the same thing and IT WORKS! Some have used carpet in their living room, others have used bathroom rugs. My mother-in-law, who told me she'd never risk breaking it, later told my wife on the phone that she had tried it with a pillow and it worked.It isn't perfect, I'd say 50% - 60% of the time this method works. I can't explain how, and honestly I don't even care anymore. The fact is, I can buy any kind of banana I want now and experience perfectly-spaced deliciousness.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28PEXGQC0C3NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28PEXGQC0C3NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Finally I have received my very own Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  For 248 days (plus 520 days for shipping and handling) I have been saving my pennies to buy this product.  Yes, for two years and just over a month I have waited to own this amazing item.  At long last, it came today.  Just after I opened the box, four ninjas leaped through the windows and thankfully, oh so fortunately, I had the Hutzler 571 in hand!  Furiously I fought them off!  And now I understand my mission in life; I armed with my Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer will rid the world of evil-doers everywhere.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">This slicer does a nice job of preparing bananas as an attractive add on to a fruit dish.Recommended  when you want to serve guests an attractive fruit salad.The banana are naturally sticky, and remnants cling to this device.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">DO NOT make the same mistake I did and believe everything on the list of features on the Hutzler banana slicer sales page!!!"Great for cereal"This is completely bogus! Knowing how great the Hutzler banana slicer was at slicing bananas, I couldn't wait to try it as cereal. I grabbed a bowl, threw in a few Hutzler banana slicers, added milk, and grabbed my spoon in anticipation. Here is where the trouble began.Not only did the Hutzler banana slicer not taste good by any stretch of the imagination, but it also sliced my voice box into 18 evenly sized pieces on its way down. Now when I speak I sound like a crowd of people at a protest all chanting the same thing (although I now do a pretty killer impression of the Yip Yip aliens from Sesame Street). This is not convenient.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Whether you choose to read further or not, if you are considering a purchase of this product, BEWARE: I am firmly convinced that the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has properties far beyond those listed in the formal description.When my H571 first arrived, I took it out of the Amazon box and let it sit on the counter. Its bright yellow color makes it a novelty item and, as such, a natural conversation piece. I hoped it would brighten the mood of my home, and it did--at first.I noticed that the frequency of visitations to my home by friends and relatives spiked rapidly. Within a week, I counted some thirty unique visitors, some of whom I had never seen before. Within a month, though I am a naturally introspective man and prefer a quiet life, I was having parties on an almost nightly basis and masses of people were circulating through my home at all hours of the night.I also found myself eating more bananas. I purchased a full bunch and found that the H571 made preparing them a breeze. I put them in cereal for breakfast, salads for lunch, and banana bread for dinner. I put bananas in buns with ketchup, relish, cheddar cheese, and chili. I also marinated bananas in teriyaki sauce and grilled them with rice and shrimp. I couldn't get enough.While I was at the grocery store purchasing more bananas for my H571, I noticed a strong, hunchbacked man glaring at me. He tried to be inconspicuous by testing the firmness of tomatoes and looking away every time I gazed in his direction, but no matter how many times he looked away, his eyes kept wandering back to me.I thought nothing of it until I saw the same man in a suit, following me in town a few days later. Then I was spooked. I walked fast and he walked fast. I ran and he ran. I ducked into a tattoo parlor and he followed me in. It was a small shop, and with my luck no one was up front, waiting for prospective clients. The hunchbacked man came into the store and pointed what felt like a banana into my back."There's something you need to know about your H571," he said."How did you know?" I said.He said no more. He turned me around and gave me a shove out the door. A black sedan was waiting on the street. The door opened and two more hunchbacks were inside. I noticed they all had the number 17 tattooed on their wrist. We drove to what appeared to be an abandoned armory building in a neglected district downtown.The hunchbacks escorted me toward the building, warning me not to dare make a sound.I was almost inside when, in a blinding yellow flash, my H571 boomeranged into my hand. It was glowing and no longer felt like plastic. It was supple and fluidly extended when I flicked it to the left or right.The hunchbacks were suddenly afraid of me. They kept their distance as I backed away toward the street.A yellow cab came by and I got in.As I drove away, the hunchbacks pleaded with me that I had much to learn about the power I possessed with the H571, and that they could teach me. But how could I trust them?When I looked down, my H571 had returned to its normal plastic state and I haven't been able to trigger its bizarre properties since.I'm glad I purchased the H571--I now believe it is much more than a banana slicer--and I hope to report on its exact nature in more detail as my understanding of it grows.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U42MT6PEXLL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U42MT6PEXLL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Works great! The trouble is cleaning the darned thing after you use it. So, it is a little frustrating if you use it. Do you want to clean in between all those pieces? If you could use it for say 5 bananas at once, maybe it is worth it. Well, I think it makes a great gift if you you know someone always slicing up a bunch of bananas... or if you need a gag gift for a bridal shower, maybe?My husband is a chef with great knife skills, and he snorted at my even buying this. So the last thing I can say it might be useful for is avoiding a knife (as someone like me should, since knives and I do not get along), or annoying a Significan Other who is a food and food tool snob.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BJYVWWCB73YT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BJYVWWCB73YT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I assumed from the photos that this slicer would produce 18 uniform banana slices.  After slicing several bananas, I counted the resulting slices and found that the number of slices produced from a single round of slicing ranged from 12 to 16 slices.  I never got the 18 slices that I expected.  I had my wife try it and she got similar results.  I checked the number of blades, and consulted with a mathematician friend to confirm that the 17 blades should produce 18 slices.  Since I couldn't get it to work, I gave up on it and threw it in the drawer. Then one day asked my daughter to bring me a ruler and she brought me the banana slicer, thinking it was some sort of cool kitchen ruler.  That's when it occurred to me to measure some bananas, and lo-and-behold, bananas come in different sizes.  I measured each banana and counted the number of slices each one produced, and found that there was a strong positive correlation between the length of the banana and the number of slices produced.  Long story short, the ONLY way to get 18 slices is to start with a banana that is exactly the same length as the slicer.  You essentially have to take the thing with you to the supermarket to make sure you have the right size banana.And don't get me started on how two of the slices don't look anything like the other slices.  Somehow they end up being pointed on one side - even though all the blades are straight.  I've found this to be most problematic near the ends of the banana.  So if consistency is your goal, I don't think you're ever going to get 18 slices out of one banana from this unit.Additionally, this slicer works only in one direction.  You have to push the slicer DOWN on top of a banana that is situated on a flat surface.  If you want to slice in a different direction, you just end up pushing the banana off the table and wind up with a banana on the floor.  And if you put the banana on top of the slicer and try to slice by lifting, all you are left with are some small dents on the bottom of the banana.  If that happens to you, all is not lost. If you have a standard knife, you can flip the banana over (make sure you mark the top some way so you know you have flipped it all the way around) and use the indentations as a guide to cut pretty decent slices. This technique also comes in handy if you push the slicer only part of the way down and then lift it up again without cutting all the way through.  This can happen if you can't accurately judge the distance to the cutting board. (There really should be some sort of gauge to let you know you've sliced all the way through.)  Anyway, if you end up having to finish cutting your own slices, you avoid wasting a perfectly good banana, but then what was the point of spending the money on a dedicated banana slicer to begin with?So if all you are looking for is something that produces an unspecified number of slices of banana under very limited conditions, then this will probably work for you.  But be prepared for some frustration and a steep learning curve.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ELMETK2MQ668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ELMETK2MQ668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">My son did like using this to slice his bananas, but I found it so annoying to clean that I stopped using it with him. Basically, I did not find this easy to clean by hand, and I also found that waiting for it to go through the dishwasher cycle was too long before we would want another banana!It works, but it is nothing special. My son and I just use a plastic knife together instead.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JECQSTRTFA0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JECQSTRTFA0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I knew my kitchen junk drawer was missing something. It has the usual obscure utensils-ice pick, meat hook, those little corn cob sticker things-but it opened so freely. I knew this was unacceptable for any kitchen junk drawer. I needed that one big thing that would barely fit in and would snag the counter every time I opened it. The Hutzler 571 was perfect! Now my drawer snags like every other junk drawer I've ever had and I have to push the Hutzler 571 down with my hand to get it open. Plus when I need 16 pieces of a banana it does the trick. Nothing worse than 9 small slices and 7 big ones on your cereal. Thanks Hutzler 571!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R69E5TE3NNU8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R69E5TE3NNU8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">After four years of being labeled a failing school by the No Child Left Behind bureaucrats, our school district totally had to totally revamp our schools, staff, curriculum and regular way of doing business. After floundering around looking for strategies and materials that will produce smarter, more engaged students with better test scores, we went all in and ordered 20,000 Hutzler 571's so every student and staff member has one for home and school.Before we Hutzlerized our math curriculum, our students tests scores were in the toilet. The revolutionary abacus adaptor kit we developed for the Hutzler allows our students to perform math functions from simple counting for kindergarten,  addition/subtraction for primary; multiplication/division and on through square and cube roots. Algebraic, calculus, etc algothrithms are being developed.When we got our fall math test scores back we were astounded!! Our students are now outperforming the Finnish, Chinese, and Singapore students. It's just unbelievable how excited our students are about their Hutzler math program. They don't even want to use their calculators anymore.We've also totally Hutzlerized our music program. Instruments cost too much money, so now we just use the Hutzler 571 for middle and high school band. Our incredible music teacher has come up with amazing techniques and arrangements for Hutzler kazoo and percussion. Of course, our middle school boys quickly figured out how to use the Hutzler under their armpit to produce additional musical offerings. Our incredible Hutzler concerts move everyone to tears.We are continually discovering new, wonderful uses for the Hutzler 571 in the educational setting. Our school nurses now use the Hutzler as a useful device for checking students for head lice. With a Hutzler in each hand the nurse can pull back the hair and probe the nits with the pointed end. We now have the highest percentage of lice reduction in the state!! Thank you Hutzler!,To conclude, as a 25 year veteran educator, I no longer feel like a dispirited, underpaid, underappreciated grunt. Thanks to the Hutzler 571, my passion for teaching has never been better, and I'm just one of many teachers in our district thinking and dreaming up incredible new lesson plans to incorporate our beloved banana slicers!Hutzler, because of you were no longer a failing school district and we've left no kid behind,</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH20QUQ5QQR83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH20QUQ5QQR83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Singapore:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">The theory behind the Hutzler 571 banana slicer is commendable.  No longer do I have to spend countless hours slaving over a hot banana to provide for my childen.  Now I have the opportunity to continue my education and get my GED.  The only complaint I have regards the limits on the size on the banana. I tried to use the banana to slice a different kind of "banana" and was thoroughly disappointed with the results, resulting in an emergency room visit.  Overall, 5 stars would recommend.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J10L4LR8OLPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J10L4LR8OLPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">A new home, a new start. That's what I thought I was getting when my husband and I moved from our home in California to chilly, dim Belmont, Maine. An ideal place to raise the kids -- Josie, 16, and Matthew, 9 -- and friendly neighbors to make every day of our small-town life worth waking up to.Alas. We purchased our spacious new home in optimistic disregard of the warnings of the townsfolk. These small towns! So superstitious! No grizzled old crone with a voice like a rusted iron gate screaming in agony is going to tell ME how to live MY life -- am I right, folks? The house was cheap, and it was exactly what we were looking for. Nothing could go wrong! Well, perhaps the skeletons of small animals we kept finding around the house should have been a clue. Perhaps the weather, which had a tendency to change from bright and sunny to horribly overcast in moments, should have made us think something was up. Perhaps even the sound of screaming in the attic, which yielded only odd scratch marks on the walls when investigated, should have tipped us off. But it didn't.In one of the kitchen drawers of our lovely home we discovered an item which I believe to be a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. My husband was overjoyed! Finally, a device which perfectly accommodated his banana-slicing needs, apparently left behind by the house's former tenants. Let me tell you, there was a reason it was left behind. Despite my reservations, I agreed to give the banana slicer a shot. It worked very well, and sliced bananas with an efficiency yet unknown to man -- and which I believe should remain unknown.A few weeks after he started using the banana slicer, my husband noticed that he was having trouble sleeping at night. The bedroom grew deathly cold, and the plumbing rattled like it was possessed. My husband complained of terrible dreams, in which giant bananas beckoned to him from the darkest corners of his mind. I begged him to stop using the banana slicer, but he ignored me, insisting it was simply the stress of his new job. I wish I had pursued the matter, but instead I dropped it, agreeing that he was probably right. I was just being silly.When the children began to come to me with marks on their backs and arms in the shape of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I knew something had to be done, before it was too late. While my husband was out one day, I threw the banana slicer into the nearby lake. However, due to its plastic composition, it quickly floated back to shore. More serious measures had to be taken. I put the banana slicer into a box, which I then nailed shut, put into another box, shut that box with chains, and buried it in the woods 20 miles from our home. My husband would be none the wiser, I thought, and we would just have to deal with the lack of convenient banana slicing in our lives. However, when I arrived home, there was the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, in my husband's hands. When he asked me where I had been, I couldn't respond. I did not truly know terror until that moment.My terror only increased when my husband began to show signs of hostility, as if the banana slicer was influencing him in some way. He was no longer the nondescript middle-class dark-haired white male I knew. Instead, he snapped at me. He refused to speak to the children. One day, he shoved me. At that point, I knew I had lost him. However, I didn't anticipate what would come next.Months later, my life was hell. I hadn't been sleeping properly. I could hardly eat, with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the kitchen at all times. The children had noticed my lethargy, and seemed afraid to be alone in the house with their father. As it turned out, they were right to be afraid. My husband, influenced by the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, flew into a murderous rage, and would have killed us all had I not stopped him... with the knife I had been using to prepare a butternut squash for dinner.These days, my mother has custody of the children. I have been spending my time recovering -- and hunting for the source of the evil that I now know to be the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I've finally found it.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">My wife, armed with a micrometer, digital scale and oak stick, insists that I provide her with banana slices that are consistently uniform in size and mass. She's a math professor (a particularly sinister breed I might add), so wasn't easily fooled. This product has finally afforded me some relief. Not only have the daily breakfast-time beatings stopped, but she's actually considering letting me watch 30 minutes of TV weekly as a reward, provided its a programme on banana slicing.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDB9J3BMLIJ26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDB9J3BMLIJ26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">It works, but the marketing is kind of a scam. Does Hutzer make a banana peeler? Sure, but don't go thinking it's included or, like me, you're gonna get your slicer and realize it's about as useful as a roll of paper towels without a paper towel dispenser until you pony up more cash and wait. (And, oh the wait feels endless.) Fortunately, or not, during my second purchase I had the foresight to consider what other essential "upgrades" I need just to make use of the original product.Let's just say that it all works beautifully, the banana scouring powder and polishing cloth, the peeler, the slicer, and the 13-head-rotating-banana-slicer-scrub-brush all deliver as promised, but I hope the excitement of flawless bananas on the kids' Christmas morning Cheerios is present enough from Santa this year. In fairness, the banana de-threader and banana seed extractor were probably unnecessary luxuries. But then again, were they? It's not as though I splurged on the titanium and redwood display case. (Honestly, at a quarter the price, the stainless steel and artisan-selected oak gets the job done without being unnecessarily ostentatious.)Part of me feels like we could have made due with just a cigar cutter, the appropriate violin strings, 1.25" and 3.75" duct tape, a repurposed loom and/or the spokes from the front wheel of a brass unicycle, a yard of bacteria-resistant crushed velvet, a baker's dozen of My Little Pony mane and tailbrushes, a set of resurfaced wooden dominoes, a pair of needle-nosed surgical-grade tweezers, and a well-trained midget. But hell, it was just one Christmas... unless the rumors about the upcoming release of Hutzer's Miracle Banana Spot Remover turn out to be true. The kids will understand.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REKCE1J9FPOSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REKCE1J9FPOSL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Santa:LOCATION, 	-Hutzer:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Whether you choose to read further or not, if you are considering a purchase of this product, BEWARE: I am firmly convinced that the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has properties far beyond those listed in the formal description.When my H571 first arrived, I took it out of the Amazon box and let it sit on the counter. Its bright yellow color makes it a novelty item and, as such, a natural conversation piece. I hoped it would brighten the mood of my home, and it did--at first.I noticed that the frequency of visitations to my home by friends and relatives spiked rapidly. Within a week, I counted some thirty unique visitors, some of whom I had never seen before. Within a month, though I am a naturally introspective man and prefer a quiet life, I was having parties on an almost nightly basis and masses of people were circulating through my home at all hours of the night.I also found myself eating more bananas. I purchased a full bunch and found that the H571 made preparing them a breeze. I put them in cereal for breakfast, salads for lunch, and banana bread for dinner. I put bananas in buns with ketchup, relish, cheddar cheese, and chili. I also marinated bananas in teriyaki sauce and grilled them with rice and shrimp. I couldn't get enough.While I was at the grocery store purchasing more bananas for my H571, I noticed a strong, hunchbacked man glaring at me. He tried to be inconspicuous by testing the firmness of tomatoes and looking away every time I gazed in his direction, but no matter how many times he looked away, his eyes kept wandering back to me.I thought nothing of it until I saw the same man in a suit, following me in town a few days later. Then I was spooked. I walked fast and he walked fast. I ran and he ran. I ducked into a tattoo parlor and he followed me in. It was a small shop, and with my luck no one was up front, waiting for prospective clients. The hunchbacked man came into the store and pointed what felt like a banana into my back."There's something you need to know about your H571," he said."How did you know?" I said.He said no more. He turned me around and gave me a shove out the door. A black sedan was waiting on the street. The door opened and two more hunchbacks were inside. I noticed they all had the number 17 tattooed on their wrist. We drove to what appeared to be an abandoned armory building in a neglected district downtown.The hunchbacks escorted me toward the building, warning me not to dare make a sound.I was almost inside when, in a blinding yellow flash, my H571 boomeranged into my hand. It was glowing and no longer felt like plastic. It was supple and fluidly extended when I flicked it to the left or right.The hunchbacks were suddenly afraid of me. They kept their distance as I backed away toward the street.A yellow cab came by and I got in.As I drove away, the hunchbacks pleaded with me that I had much to learn about the power I possessed with the H571, and that they could teach me. But how could I trust them?When I looked down, my H571 had returned to its normal plastic state and I haven't been able to trigger its bizarre properties since.I'm glad I purchased the H571--I now believe it is much more than a banana slicer--and I hope to report on its exact nature in more detail as my understanding of it grows.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U42MT6PEXLL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3U42MT6PEXLL5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">It has been said it takes 3 cups of tea to get things done in Afghanistan.  When I was deployed in 2006, it took only the HBS. (army slang for the Hutzler Banana Slicer, we like our acronyms) See, there was much frustration between the Afghan Army and we US advisers. Acrimony reigned due to cultural differences, misunderstandings and a general feeling of malevolence. However, after eating 3 day old naan, and drinking yet another cup of over sweet, very weak chai tea, my Afghan hosts were about to slice a banana for desert.  I stopped them, and motioned to my ruck sack, where I withdrew the HBS and promptly, yet expertly sliced their bananas.  Amazed and appreciative beyond words,I was quickly accepted into their clan, and we were able to chase the Taliban out of our area of operations in a newly unified and allied operation. It wasn't long until President Obama announced that the surge troops would be withdrawing and all combat forces would be leaving by 2014.  Coincidence? I don't think so.  Thanks Hutzler.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KJMPU2G47FU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KJMPU2G47FU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Afghanistan:LOCATION, 	-HBS:ORGANIZATION, 	-Afghan:ORGANIZATION, 	-Army:ORGANIZATION, 	-US:LOCATION, 	-HBS:ORGANIZATION, 	-Taliban:ORGANIZATION, 	-Obama:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Although much better than some of the earlier Hutzler designs (Hutzler 132 made my dishwasher smoke, 287 could only be used on one banana, 334 wasn't even banana-shaped and 440 was nothing but an orangutan), the 571 doesn't really improve much on the 560s to justify the price. In my opinion, they had all the kinks sorted out around 524ish and just keep issuing new models to prey on people who simply must have the newest model.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Sigh...day 130 without my chef knife. When I first purchased my banana slicer I was amazed at the efficiency, sleek design, and practicality. But my chef knife was instantly green with jealousy. Time went on and things started happening. First, my knife literally stabbed the banana slicer while in the kitchen drawer. I found its tip buried in one of the holes of the slicer. Next, my knife just sliced my finger out of the blue while cutting strawberries. No, warning. No communication. This cut me to the bone. Next thing I know my chef knife moved out of the kitchen drawer and left for the garage. It said it wanted space. And needed to cut things like duck tape and such. I'm just at a stand still really.

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">It all started innocently enough in high school.  Some people thought little Billy Epstein and I were gay, but we really took Home Ec class because that was where all the chicks were.  We learned a lot in that class - about life, our sexuality, pubescent females and food prep.  Our teacher, Ed Banapeel, was very competitive.  We sliced and we diced into all hours of the night practicing and hoping that we could all get full-ride scholarships to culinary schools.  Banapeel was certain that would elevate his program higher than the football and basketball programs combined.  He needed to find a competitive edge and one day found it on Amazon - the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It was faster than anything we had seen before, and clean-up was a breeze.  However, the Hutzler 571 is so much more.Being adolescent males, we decided to sneak a Hutzler 571 out of the school to spend more time with it and realize its full potential.  We found ourselves in the Home Ec room at the precise moment when Banapeel's morning coffee kicked in and he made a beeline to the bathroom to lighten his load.  Little Billy grabbed the Hutzler 571 and jammed it down his pants in a flash.  We tried to make our way to the doorway without anybody noticing us, but little Billy caught the attention of every girl in the class (if you know what I mean).  As soon as we hit the hallway, we were off and running.  We knew we would get in trouble for skipping school, but we didn't care.  We had the Hutzler 571 and it was ours.  We made it all the way to little Billy's house.  We knew we were safe there because his parents both worked during the day.  His Mom was a Slinky tester and his Dad licked envelopes for the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  In all the excitement after we arrived at his house, little Billy pulled the Hutzler 571 out of his pants a little too quickly.  He is now a Eunuch.But our story doesn't end there.  We buried the Hutzler 571 in little Billy's backyard to avoid suspicion.  However, we had to keep burying it because several dogs and a raccoon kept digging it back up with all of the blood on it.  After little Billy had finally healed, we decided to see what the Hutzler 571 could do.  After all, we never got that chance before due to little Billy's misfortune.  As little Billy was lifting it from the ground, the dogs were all over it, so I grabbed it and threw it like a boomerang.  With amazing accuracy it went out about 100 yards and made a perfect turn and trajectory right back to my hand.  I didn't have to move.  It was just there.  Little Billy was awestruck.  He tried to do the same thing, but failed miserably (like most paper airplanes he made in his lifetime).  Not wanting him to feel bad, I told him that maybe we could play catch with it and use it like a frisbee instead of a boomerang.  Poor little Billy lost 2 fingers that day.  He was a good sport about it, but never picked up another Hutzler 571.So, I finally had the Hutzler 571 all to myself.  I took it out and continued using it like a boomerang and found my accuracy improving exponentially.  I started taking out pigeons in mid-flight and progressed to bats at dusk.  I was getting the attention of everyone on the neighborhood and crowds started forming to watch me use my new honed skills.  The crowds grew and grew even larger.  At first I was surprised to see the college scouts, but I was more impressed to learn that Hutzler was after me to found it's very own Hutzler 571 Boomerang League.  It was when the Secret Service showed up that I started to get scared.  I was afraid that old Banapeel was finally on to me and had figured out I had pinched the Hutzler 571.  That wasn't it at all.  They wanted me to go skeet shooting with Barack Obama.  Don't tell the POTUS, but he never hit a clay pigeon to save his life.  It was really me and my Hutzler 571 hiding off in the woods.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R47HAWHHDXE5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R47HAWHHDXE5D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Epstein:PERSON, 	-Ed:PERSON, 	-Banapeel:PERSON, 	-Banapeel:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Banapeel:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Billy:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Secret:ORGANIZATION, 	-Service:ORGANIZATION, 	-Banapeel:PERSON, 	-Barack:PERSON, 	-Obama:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">Why a banana slicer?  Because it saves a lot of time.  I freeze banana slices.  They turn out to be bite-size deserts that taste sweeter than many treats when frozen.  I add no sugar, but I occasionally dip the frozen bits into chocolate sauce.  Hmmmmmm, good!  The slicer very simply saves a lot of time and is worth it's price.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11RFXPYKNLDIL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11RFXPYKNLDIL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I may not live very long after posting this so please understand how important this information is that I am about to give. There will soon be a Benzali 7000 Banana Slicer that will slice two banana at the same time resulting in 36 perfectly formed slices. Yes, as impossible as this seems, Benzali has found a way to double your banana slicing pleasure by halving the time to slice two bananas. Even more impossible sounding is that it will also work with just one banana meaning you will only need a single device to cut either 1 or 2 bananas.I have seen the new device and took a picture but was caught by Benzali Security who took my camera and locked me in a room. I crawled through a ventilation duct and slid outside and swore I would let the public know what is about to transpire. I now travel in the dark of night with a cyanide tablet at the ready for I know if Benzali ever finds me the torture I would be subjected to is worse than death itself. Fortunately, the cyanide is banana flavored and I will leave this earthly plane with a smile upon my face.Stay strong banana lovers and wait for your chance to buy the perfect device.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21GGIP6H1320S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21GGIP6H1320S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Benzali:PERSON, 	-Benzali:PERSON, 	-Benzali:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">I purchased two of the Hutzler 571 Banana slicers - one for home and the other for when traveling to relatives in other systems. My crew aboard the Millennium Falcon enjoys having fresh bananas as they're a great snack in zero gravity. HOWEVER, instead of making bananas easier to eat in space, we ended up with bananas slices flying all over the place! One even got jammed in the control, preventing us from going to light speed, extending our journey to grandma's by 500 extra years. Christmas dinner was COLD when we arrived thanks to this slicer!Hutzler, please make it clear that these slicers are not good for intergalactic travel. I'll be sending one slicer back.EDIT: I realized the mistake was on me, I realize now I should have gotten the 571R2-D2 unit that would have been compatible with my droid. Hutzler was kind enough to give me a replacement at no charge. We're back up to banana slicing light speed!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11CLKZBIYULP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11CLKZBIYULP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">You should be ashamed of yourselves for making fun of such a fine and useful product.The truth is, it's useless for slicing bananas. Rather than producing the perfect clean-edged slices you see in the photo, it just mashes up even the most stouthearted, "Okay, if my time has come, at least I'm going to end up as some fine-looking slices of myself"-type banana.And then you're left with this big, messy, banana-covered plastic thing that takes 10 minutes to wash by hand. Sure, you can throw it in the dishwasher--but what's next? Throwing your neighbor's barking dog in your dishwasher, or your rude teens, or your psychotic boss? Do you really want to start thinking of your dishwasher as the ultimate solution to life's problems? Not a good idea.So if it's so impractical, why do I give this product five stars? Because it has another purpose, something it does astoundingly well: You can use it to hang-dry and re-use pieces of dental floss. I have about 30 strands going on mine as we speak. I'll probably never have to buy another spool of floss again.And because it's shaped like a banana, you can hang it in your kitchen and add a festive, novel floss-themed accent to the friendliest room in your house. (If your bathroom is the friendliest room in your house, you obviously don't need any help in the decorating department.) If only Martha Stewart had known about this in prison, where I'm sure she was using one sink for everything.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROEGTL6ZIL367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROEGTL6ZIL367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Martha:PERSON, 	-Stewart:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Like many other reviewers, this life changing product has changed my life. First that was good, but now it was bad. Allow me to explain. I recently brought the Hutzler on a flight to the East Coast. As I began slicing bananas for my own superb in-flight meal, the kid next to me got so excited he started yelling like crazy (of course, many children have this reaction when seeing it for the first time, we all know that). This got the attention of some other passengers and then a flight attendant. Upon viewing the Hutzler Handiwork (as I call it), the lame flight attendant yelled out "BANANA TERRORIST! BANANA TERRORIST!" Three rows up an Air Marshall leapt from his seat, witnessed my miracle food, and promptly shot me to death.  So I post this review posthumously, from heaven, where I sadly report... there are no bananas. I did leave Hutzlers to each of my 12  children and their 5 mothers though, so my life is in order.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16OGWA7JAHWNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16OGWA7JAHWNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-East:LOCATION, 	-Coast:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Handiwork:PERSON, 	-Air:PERSON, 	-Marshall:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">My wife always complains that I "suck down bananas too fast".  They are my favorite fruit and I usually down 3-4 in a row.  This sweet banana train clogs my throat and has sent me into the emergency room dozens of times.  I recall an instance where I was busy chugging my 4th savory sugar pole, when my cousin made a grand joke about Rhinos and I let out a guffaw that projected the bananas out of my mouth like North Korean ballistic missiles.  One of the kids was maimed and still hasnt regained their sight.The banana slicer forces me to eat it in bite sized hockey pucks.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">A new home, a new start. That's what I thought I was getting when my husband and I moved from our home in California to chilly, dim Belmont, Maine. An ideal place to raise the kids -- Josie, 16, and Matthew, 9 -- and friendly neighbors to make every day of our small-town life worth waking up to.Alas. We purchased our spacious new home in optimistic disregard of the warnings of the townsfolk. These small towns! So superstitious! No grizzled old crone with a voice like a rusted iron gate screaming in agony is going to tell ME how to live MY life -- am I right, folks? The house was cheap, and it was exactly what we were looking for. Nothing could go wrong! Well, perhaps the skeletons of small animals we kept finding around the house should have been a clue. Perhaps the weather, which had a tendency to change from bright and sunny to horribly overcast in moments, should have made us think something was up. Perhaps even the sound of screaming in the attic, which yielded only odd scratch marks on the walls when investigated, should have tipped us off. But it didn't.In one of the kitchen drawers of our lovely home we discovered an item which I believe to be a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. My husband was overjoyed! Finally, a device which perfectly accommodated his banana-slicing needs, apparently left behind by the house's former tenants. Let me tell you, there was a reason it was left behind. Despite my reservations, I agreed to give the banana slicer a shot. It worked very well, and sliced bananas with an efficiency yet unknown to man -- and which I believe should remain unknown.A few weeks after he started using the banana slicer, my husband noticed that he was having trouble sleeping at night. The bedroom grew deathly cold, and the plumbing rattled like it was possessed. My husband complained of terrible dreams, in which giant bananas beckoned to him from the darkest corners of his mind. I begged him to stop using the banana slicer, but he ignored me, insisting it was simply the stress of his new job. I wish I had pursued the matter, but instead I dropped it, agreeing that he was probably right. I was just being silly.When the children began to come to me with marks on their backs and arms in the shape of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I knew something had to be done, before it was too late. While my husband was out one day, I threw the banana slicer into the nearby lake. However, due to its plastic composition, it quickly floated back to shore. More serious measures had to be taken. I put the banana slicer into a box, which I then nailed shut, put into another box, shut that box with chains, and buried it in the woods 20 miles from our home. My husband would be none the wiser, I thought, and we would just have to deal with the lack of convenient banana slicing in our lives. However, when I arrived home, there was the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, in my husband's hands. When he asked me where I had been, I couldn't respond. I did not truly know terror until that moment.My terror only increased when my husband began to show signs of hostility, as if the banana slicer was influencing him in some way. He was no longer the nondescript middle-class dark-haired white male I knew. Instead, he snapped at me. He refused to speak to the children. One day, he shoved me. At that point, I knew I had lost him. However, I didn't anticipate what would come next.Months later, my life was hell. I hadn't been sleeping properly. I could hardly eat, with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the kitchen at all times. The children had noticed my lethargy, and seemed afraid to be alone in the house with their father. As it turned out, they were right to be afraid. My husband, influenced by the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, flew into a murderous rage, and would have killed us all had I not stopped him... with the knife I had been using to prepare a butternut squash for dinner.These days, my mother has custody of the children. I have been spending my time recovering -- and hunting for the source of the evil that I now know to be the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I've finally found it. Now, its undoing can begin, and I will finally have my life back...</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23W9TV2K0DU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23W9TV2K0DU4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-California:LOCATION, 	-Maine:LOCATION, 	-Josie:PERSON, 	-Matthew:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I was very disappointed with this item.  The description says it is "great for cereal" but I struggled for hours trying to slice my cereal.  I tried all sorts of cereals, most were too small and simply slotted through the gaps whilst others were either too hard or too crumbly.  It doesn't slice the flake type of cereal at all well and you may as well forget about "in bowl" slicing altogether.  The banana shape is quite restrictive too, it's probably only any good for slicing bananas and not cereal as the ad. suggests.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37PU69JLZ94QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37PU69JLZ94QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">For years I searched. Stores, online marketplaces, black markets, swap meets, after hours clubs...the list goes on. No matter how far and wide I searched, never could I find a product to slice my bananas to symmetric perfection. I thought I had found one in the `90s but it turned out to be a hoax.But then it happened. I found the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I brought my brandy new 571 to work with me the day it arrived in the mail. I could barely think straight, waiting for lunch time. The moment had finally come. I peeled my banana with anxiousness unparalleled and laid the glorious product upon it. In a moment, time stopped. I pulled the slicer upwards to reveal perfect, I mean PERFECT individual exact slices.I was so excited! I lept from my chair so to stand up straight in front of my colleagues with pride. I threw my hands up in the air and shouted at the top of my lungs "HAIL HUTZLER!" APPARENTLY, my co-workers and the security guards do not share my bananathusiasm as I was promptly fired and escorted from the office. Luckily though, not before I had safely tucked my 571 in my pocket.

She lived in a poor mining village in which there was only one single banana slicer, centrally located for all to use.  She would often speak to me of the long treks to the banana slicer and back, uphill both ways, shoeless, trudging through three feet of snow and stopping only to warm her feet in cow pies when her toes began to turn blue.  If only Oma were alive to see this amazing invention.  Thanks to the very affordable and widely available Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, Oma's successors will not have to struggle to enjoy perfectly sliced bananas as she did.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27KAF9GVH8GQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27KAF9GVH8GQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Oma:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Long ago, deep within the heart of Mt. Plantain, a sole banana slicer was forged. Inscribed in the edge was the text "Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. One slicer to rule them all. One banana to find them. One perfect wedge to bring them all, and without a knife slice them." The power was too much for mere mortals, and though they had innocent intentions, the power of perfect banana slices overcame them. One by one the mortals fell, and so it was determined: For the sake of mankind, the One Slicer had to be destroyed.It was quite by fate--and the will of a pothead--that I came across this product on Amazon. The reviews were good, so I bought it, but little did I know that soon my soul would be consumed by the ancient weapon of darkness. I eagerly awaited its arrival, contemplating the immense ease and efficiency with which I would soon be able to slice my bananas.Later that week, as I was practicing my turkey call, I suddenly heard a knock at the door. I leaped to my feet, anticipating the arrival of my beautiful banana slicer. I threw open the door, only to be greeted by a man in a gray robe. "Do you have any spare towels?" He inquired, "This is my roommate's bathrobe and I already used the curtains last week." He forced his way in and made himself comfortable.He was a peculiar man who stood nearly seven feet tall and smelled of sweet cannabis. Shocked by his uninvited entrance, I stood there dumbly until another knock at the door shook me out of my stupor.It was the UPS man; he had come to deliver my precious banana slicer. I was about to sign for the package, when suddenly, my uninvited house guest pushed me aside and shouted with all his might, "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!".The UPS man looked absolutely horrified. Right as I was about to apologize, the man in robes pushed his way out of the door and took off down the street. "That may be the strangest thing that has happened this week!" I remarked. After asking me to sign for the package, the UPS man asked me for my autograph to give to his daughter, who was a huge fan of my turkey calling skills.Rushing inside as soon as I could, I stared at the package which I knew contained everything my heart desired. I clawed at the package, desperately trying to free the precious slicer--MY precious slicer--But the power that bound this box could not be undone. As I was clamoring for a method to unleash the power of my very own banana slicer, I was once again interrupted by the man in the robes."Don't open it!" he shouted, as he barged through the door. "The power that is contained in that box will unleash a barrage of evil that will consume all of mankind!" Immediately after uttering these words, he collapsed on the carpet and did not come to for three days.When he regained consciousness, and the substance that clouded his mind had dissipated, he blurted out, "Is it secret? Is it safe?" Soon after, he proceeded to inform me of the ancient legend of this very banana slicer."It consumed the souls of every mortal who has ever tried to wield its power" he said. "The simplicity and perfection of the slicer corrupted the hearts of even the most honorable men. The ease with which it slices was far too much for this world, and soon its dark power covered the world with darkness.""What can be done?" I asked. I could feel the slicer calling to me, so I knew it was legit."We must return it from whence it came," he replied. "Through the chasm of the Brooklyn Bridge, across Manhattan to the center of Connecticut, where the fires of Mt. Plantain still burn; the only fire hot enough to consume the slicer once and for all. It will be a long a perilous journey, not for the faint of heart.""The slicer is my burden." I said solemnly, as I realized the sealing of my fate. Thus, I embarked on a journey that would forever change the fate of the world.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REHUKU9S27P0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REHUKU9S27P0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-UPS:ORGANIZATION, 	-UPS:ORGANIZATION, 	-Brooklyn:LOCATION, 	-Bridge:LOCATION, 	-Manhattan:LOCATION, 	-Connecticut:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I was so excited when the package arrived.  I unboxed with anticipation.  I couldn't wait to use it.  Unfortunately, no instructions were included.  I called my friends for assistance and they immediately came over.  We tried using it several times but it just wouldn't slice through the bananas.  After multiple attempts and several drinks, a buddy recommended that we peel the banana first.  Wouldn't you know it, it sliced perfectly.  My only gripe is all the wasted bananas and 45 minutes of my life wasted.  Otherwise, great product.  I know what I'm giving to family as a stocking stuffer this Christmas!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CCN261JK76T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CCN261JK76T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Since we are all being so open and honest, please allow me to share my experience. As an officer of the law, I spend a great deal of time on the road in my unit. Often I do not have enough time to eat so ill bring a grand ole banana for the road. Often when my stomach rumbles for potassium and substance I look to my banana with despair as I realize my duty knife will not suffice in cutting the banana into manageable road slices. Out of frustration I hook the banana to my gun belt until I feel I'll have enough time to slice it. This was a wonderful idea... Until the day I had to clear a building with a possible suspect inside. I went to draw my duty weapon but in my haste I drew the banana. Luckily I squished it hard enough that I was able to survive the situation as the unsheathed banana fired out like a projectile, dropping the suspect. Since I've acquired the the B571, this has never happened since, (thank God). Do not bring a banana to a gun fight, but do make room on your gun belt for the B571 banana slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPKTDWLQ13LN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPKTDWLQ13LN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

As soon as I came across this big yellow smile, I knew I had found the perfect item to turn my frown upside down.  Without reading the description any further I ordered this little jewel.  I waited eagerly for my slice of happiness to arrive.  I realized I had a real treasure when I opened the package.  Not only did I have a smile to brighten my days, I had a kitchen gadget, too!!!  I was so estactic that I knew I had to rush to the corner market right away to buy a bunch of bananas.  To my continued misfortune, the man in the market had just sold his last banana.  I strolled down the little dirt road back to my hotel.  On the way I passed a cantina and decided to go in to drown my sorrows.  Now that I knew my plastic yellow smile could do more, just having it was not enough.  I was sitting alone at the end of the bar in the little cantina re-reading the instructions for my beloved 571B Banana Slicer for the enth time to be sure I would be ready to use her properly when I could finally find a ripe pealed banana.  Suddenly there was a commotion behind me.  A green bottle with two red exes came sliding down the bar and stopped right beside my Slicer. In slow motion, a man with beautiful silver hair sat down beside me and peeled back his banana.  His peel landed in the trash behind the bar in one smooth swoop.  Girls swooned all around him.  "May I borrow your slicer?," he asked.  I nodded, unable to speak.  In a deep, sexy voice he said, "I don't always eat bananas, but when I do, I slice them up even with my 571B."Needless to say, I joined his harem of swooning girls and traveled the world doing only the most interesting things.  I always travel with my 571B.  After all, it changed my life and made me one of the most interesting women in the world!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGHFDXXC8FXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGHFDXXC8FXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I give this product 2 stars.  The description does not say so, but the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, unlike other Hutzler BS models, lacks iPhone integration.Not sure if this was just a design oversight, a deliberate effort by Hutzler to marginalize Apple's profits, or just a reflection of the natural animosity between Apple and Banana.At any rate, after multiple calls to the Hutzler I.T. department went nowhere (high call volume), I came up with my own work-around.  Here's what you need to do:1) Balance the two ends of the 571 Banana Slicer on two soup cans.  (Campbell's "Double Noodle" works best -- Do NOT use Minestrone)2) Place your cereal bowl between the soup cans.3) Place peeled banana on top of the 571 Banana Slicer.  (Banana MUST be pre-peeled.  Will NOT work if you wait to peel it later, per my results on several tries!)4) Place iPhone flush with the 571 over the banana and apply downward pressure, uniformly, keeping the iPhone flat.If you do this correctly, the banana will be forced through the 571 Banana Slicer by the force of the iPhone.  Many of the slices will land in your cereal bowl.  Switch your iPhone to the "spoon" app and enjoy!This work-around makes the 571 usable despite the lack of iPhone integration, but all in all it may be better appreciated by those with smart phones running Android.The 571 is still worth every penny, even for iPhone users, since the technique above will allow you to get perfectly sliced bananas with a lot less pulp sticking in the grooves and buttons than the "old" way of slicing bananas with your iPhone.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PXKS4CFIX8YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PXKS4CFIX8YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Apple:ORGANIZATION, 	-Apple:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Campbell:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Alright, there is one recurring theme about this piece of space-age banana slicing technology that I need to address: "Does this product use metric?". The answer is hell no cupcake! This here is Freedom, Freedom from having to slice bananas in stages, Freedom from taxes, Freedom that comes in a box. You think something like this could possibly come in metric? Hell No!This right here is 'Murica - distilled into a flexible banana shaped shell. If you want metric why don't you go get yourself a plantain slicer? Here in 'Murica we adopt your fruit...make it a staple of our breakfasts, and then redistribute it to the world as if it was our own idea! So next time you grab a little yellow slice of heaven just remember. Royal System of Weights and Measures. Yeah...we even kept the system and now its ours! Boom.So next time you want to ask, "Does this use the metric system?" - go into the bathroom...sigh a bit...take off those little European hip hugging dignity killers you got on and go Commando like the U S of A, or just swaddle your jewels in that peel from the banana you just ate.Because Freedom.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21A4322WO9U0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21A4322WO9U0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Murica:LOCATION, 	-Murica:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I feel cheated and ashamed.  I bought the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer because I could only cut 487 bananas.  Every time I tried to cut the magic 488 bananas the knife would stall out and I would be left with a banana lying on the bottom of the stack, unsliced and mocking.  Then came the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It seemed too good to be true.  The first time I took it out of its packaging I could hardly contain myself.  I ran to the kitchen, stacked up the entire 571 bananas on the first try, and gave "one quick motion" with my new Hutzler.  But it was a lie!  The Hutzler only went through 220 bananas!  There were still 351 bananas stacked on the counter, unsliced and mocking.  I still feel ashamed.  I really should have known.  Slicing 571 bananas is impossible.I'm still giving it five stars because I bought four of them so the kids could slice their own bananas, and we turned them into excellent snow shoes for our pet wiener dog.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24MYE0DFP2KRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24MYE0DFP2KRF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I was recently on a sight seeing tour deep in the Amazon (no relation) when I became separated from my group.  I soon became captured by a hostile tribe of natives, and was sure I was going to become that day's lunch.  I searched my pockets for whatever trinket I might find to buy myself a little time, when I found my Hutzler 571 Banana slicer.  I set up a makeshift demonstration table on a large tree trunk and demonstrated to the tribe's elders the amazing symmetrical banana slicing capabilities of this wonderful device.  fortunately for me the ancient scrolls had predicted that one day a bald, fat, white man would appear with impeccable banana slicing skills and would deliver the tribe from their shabbily sliced banana woes.  I was swept up on the shoulders of the tribesmen and immediately worshiped as a deity.  Unbeknownst to me, there had been a great division in the tribe between those who sliced bananas longways with a machete, and those who squished them up into little balls and served them that way.  I had brought the tribes together and avoided a bloody civil war.  Small children sang ballads about me.  After a few weeks, I made the difficult decision to leave the tribe and find my way back to civilization.  I left the banana slicer at the elder's doorstep and snuck away in the middle of the night.  For three weeks, I battled snakes, leeches and the occasional jaguar to find my way out of the jungle.  The worse part of the ordeal was having to survive on unevenly shaped banana slices.  I have now made my way back home and will definitely be ordering myself a second Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30W5MV14HLQS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30W5MV14HLQS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">My wife got this for me for our anniversary, and at first I wasn't happy with the fact that none of the bananas we bought fit the Hutzler 571 form factor closely enough to make it worthwhile. The bananas were either too big or too small, or their curvatures were far off from that of the 571. There was nothing I could do to get full, even cuts of a Dole or Chiquita banana. I tried off-brands from time to time, but they, too, never fit.And then I said to myself, "Hey, this thing fits in my pocket."On our next trip to the supermarket, I went over to the banana display, pulled out my trusty 571, and held it up to each individual banana so I could pick out only the ones that fit the form factor and would therefore slice up fully and evenly. Other shoppers were getting annoyed that I was pulling individual bananas off the bunches, but when I explained what I was doing everyone seemed to back off and just let me do my thing.Now, every banana we take home fits perfectly in the Hutzler 571! I get beautiful, evenly spaced banana slices to add to my favorite bowl foods: yogurt, cereal and milk, oatmeal, lentil soup, etc.Great item. Highly recommended!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RO4ABKYOK4E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RO4ABKYOK4E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I'll have to give it another try, perhaps, but usually I start wanting to dehydrate bananas when they are getting over ripe, and this kind of mushes them a little, and makes the slices too big to dehydrate quickly. It works well enough, I suppose, but I will probably look for a better brand if I decide to keep using it.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFOA4CHMVSNTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFOA4CHMVSNTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I bought this product to gain an advantage in the high stakes world of banana cutting roulette in Bogata, Columbia. My game was really getting elevated and I was close to winning it all, until a discruntled competitor accused me of cheating by using the Hutzler 571 banana slicer and demanded satisfaction. The situation became elevated and I ended up killing this man that day in self defense.

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">While this product was above average in some respects (it did a perfectly serviceable job slicing bananas), it was almost useless for peeling grapes.  Why wouldn't Hutzler ensure that it could do both, knowing full well that nobody eats bananas without grapes?  I'm happy to give it 3 stars because of the fine craftsmanship, but they are going to have to address this grape peeling issue if they want to earn four - or if they can handle peeling AND slicing the grapes, perhaps I could see my way clear to 5.  I've sent Hutzler a strongly-worded letter from my lawyers and will update this group if I hear back from them.  Otherwise, I will have to go forward with a $10,000,000 suit against them.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN8CGYW0H7O6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN8CGYW0H7O6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I'm shocked at some of the poor reviews I have read here.  The complaints about the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer curving the wrong way are completely ridiculous.  Cmon, use your brains people!!  Is it really that hard??  The solution is so simple.  You just need to order TWO Hutzler 571 Banana Slicers....one which curves left, and one which curves right!  Problem solved, and now you can slice BOTH TYPES OF BANANAS WITH EASE.  The only snag here is the box is not marked so it's not clear at first which version of the slicer you get, so you might have to order a couple extra until you get one which curves the right way.  However, the extras make FANTASTIC gifts since I'm sure we all agree that life without the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is like living in the stone ages.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CVM5PDRWRG66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CVM5PDRWRG66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">For years I've been using banana peels all over my lawn to keep away the murderous hordes trying to pop all my precious balloons. (I have have beautiful handmade and vintage balloons, so the hoards REALLY want in!) I just wasn't finding it the most effective method of home defense, and I needed something... MORE...Enter the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer! This has saved my life (literally) and my precious balloons! Before, I was just eating the bananas after I peeled them. With the slicer, I had a brilliant a-ha moment: slice the bananas up, freeze them, and launch them at my attackers!! Now frozen banana shrapnel has increased my defense points by 200 points. I no longer have to rush out into my yard armed with a screwdriver and pot lid to fight them off myself. I've lost 20 pounds now that I'm not eating all those bananas, and I've been able to devote my time to building a wall to fortify my defenses even more.Thank you, Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, from the bottom of my heart!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CFS0COEYXOKL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CFS0COEYXOKL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">Let me cut straight t the point.  On New Year's eve 2011, my girlfriend and I sat down for a romantic dinner at our home.  The candles were lit,  music was gently drifting through the room, and the lasagna was hot out of the oven.  At the bottom of her wine glasses rested the engagement ring, I intended to propose to her with...I'll save you the dramatics, but due to an ill-timed knock at the door, I left the room - leaving the love of my life to throw back her drink, swallowing the engagement ring in the process.Upon my return, after a brief moment of shock, I explained to my girlfriend what she had done.  I'll never forget the look on her face.  We were both bewildered on what course of action to take.After some consideration of our options, our eyes met, ans we knew exactly how to get out of this jam.  The Hutzler 571 banana slicer!Fast forward 3 days, 20 bowls of Fiber One, and 16 perfectly dissected "colon cobras" later, we located the ring!  I have to say the experience made us closer.  And best of all, she said YES!I am happy to report that she has since said ,"I doo", and we are happily married.  Best of all, our Hutzler 571 banana slicer is as sharp as ever.  It's going to be great for slicing up 'naners for our son (yes she's pregnant!).  James Hutzler Jenkins is due in July. :)</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R8BNVHZ6AFCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R8BNVHZ6AFCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-James:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Jenkins:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I received Hutzler 571 banana slicer in a timely fashion and was pleasantly surprised at just how amazing it is...once I figured out how to use it. Word of warning: this comes with NO instructions!Before purchasing the Hutzler 571, it took an agonizing 15 seconds to cut a banana by hand, but now it only takes a mere 2 seconds!! I now have an extra 13 seconds of "me" time on banana days!!!! That extra 13 seconds has all but restored my sanity... so, I guess you could say that the Hutzler 571 banana slicer keeps me from going crazy ...so..it has SAVED MY LIFE!THANK YOU HUTZLER 571!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S21I2V7KXI3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S21I2V7KXI3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I have severe ADHD and before the 571 I could never complete the task of slicing an entire banana without wandering off.brbAnyway, only problem now is that I have OCD and there are banana-slice marks everywhere. No one visits me. I have marks on my chest that look suspiciously like the 571 pattern. Also, my cat is missing her tail, but I don't think it was me.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MSYWLUSS2QEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MSYWLUSS2QEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I must confess that I was more than a little skeptical about this product when it was recommended to me. Our marriage was totally on the rocks. As far as we were concerned, nothing could save us; it was too late. Years of unresolved banana-slicing issues had killed all traces of our love. We had tried counseling, but found that there is NO ONE out there who understands this marriage-killer. "Lighten up! Does it really matter if the banana slices are perfect?" they would flippantly ask. Or, worse: "Isn't your marriage worth spending 10 seconds slicing a sticky banana with a knife?" We could find no help anywhere, and we knew the problem was only going to get worse with time, as we entered our golden years and had to eat more and more bananas to keep our potassium levels up.Well, thanks to all the great reviews, (especially the one from KRWE30 with the very relevant rhetorical question of, "what's the point of even getting married if you can't find a quality banana slicer?"), I decided to check into this new device. I sought advice from trusted friends, and with the support I got from them, I approached my husband. We prayed about it together, and he was finally convinced by the review from Happyhubby with the military endorsement. It was a big decision, but we decided our marriage was worth one more try, and we sprung for the Victoria 571B model. No cheap substitutes; we had too much at stake.Oh. My. Word.I nearly wept with joy after the first use. If you have never had banana-slicing issues, it is hard to understand the difference this humble little tool has made in our marriage. NO more grumbling about slicing bananas, EVER. Now, if you can believe it, we even tease each other about who "gets" to slice them that day, lol, it's so much fun to use it. We have talked about splurging on a second one!Don't wait til it's too late, like we almost did. I see the price has dropped to $5.49. We bought ours when they were $8.50, but we have no regrets; it has been so worth it.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NMZFUPFEQALF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NMZFUPFEQALF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Happyhubby:LOCATION, 	-Victoria:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">Initially, I had a bit of difficulty using this product.  I pressed down firmly, but the banana slicer was not effectively slicing my banana.  Finally, after much confusion and frustration, I realized you must first peel the banana before attempting to slice it with the slicer.  After I removed the peel from the banana, the slicer worked quite well.I like to carry my bananas around in my front pants pocket.  Before I purchased this product, I used to get a lot of "is that a banana in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?" jokes.  Not anymore!  The banana slices fit comfortably in my front (and back) pockets, and now my life is embarrassment-free.  Thanks Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!As an added plus, when I'm not using it to slice my bananas, the product also works perfectly as a banana-shaped ladder for my Star Wars action figure collection.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H6HUJOPXPPDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H6HUJOPXPPDN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">When I asked my wife what she wanted for Christmas, she said, "It's 10 inches long, plastic and shaped like a banana." This was the Christmas request I had been waiting for! Unaware that Amazon even sold sex toys, I was not about to ask questions, forging ahead with my order, expedited delivery... Imagine then my confusion when it arrived in the mail and she took it right out of my hands and announced that she'd be keeping it in the kitchen! Crestfallen doesn't even cover it. It took a week to muster the courage but I managed to ask recently if I might be allowed to watch her play with it at some point and she said it's not a game but if I'm ever at home when she does, she'll try to remember to call me in. So we're not completely dead in the water. Overall this gift has been much more one-sided than I had hoped but she does seem to love it and in the mean time, I remain optimistic.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DOLBA5EB8GD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DOLBA5EB8GD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">The Hutzler 570 was a good product but the newly upgraded 571 overcomes many of it's shortcomings.  Instead of the red rim of the 570, the 571 is yellow - that's the same color as bananas - so no more accidental tomato / bell pepper slicing.Best cleaned with a Philips Somicare (not included), and for more stubborn slots at either end use non-minted floss.Skip the instruction manual, the quick start guide is all you need for basic banana slicing.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F6RD8A51CD4T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F6RD8A51CD4T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Mine is a cautionary tale--a tale of greed, success, lust, fame--and depravity. You see, I... am a slice addict. As you will see, I was among the greatest and most profligate banana slicers in the world. My slicing was legendary. I sliced with John Belushi, Lindsay Lohan, R Kelly, George "Cowboy Banana Cowboy" Bush, Barack "Slicedaddy" Obama, Keith Richards-I once sliced with Chris Farley for 60 hours straight. I was living the high life, until it all came crashing down around me.You see, for years, I was lost in a morass of banana-slicing impotence, aimlessly wandering through life obsessed with finding the perfect banana-slicing instrument. A simple google search yields thousands of competent and admirable banana-slicing products and methods, or b-slizzle as we slice addicts call it, but none measured up to my expectations of banana-slicing grace. I was a substance addict, my tonic being a soft, smooth, perfect banana slice. At first, it was a simple hobby. Like most of you, I would spend no more than five or six hours a day slicing, displaying, posting on facebook, and then consuming. Of course it's probably obvious to most of you now that for those of us with the sliceaholic gene, this level of slicing is not near enough to satiate our desires and can only end up in disaster. But being a true addict, I was blind to the pain I was causing others and deaf to the warnings of friends, family and activists. I ended up hurting those who love me the most: kids, grandkids, wives, parents, and my pet hedgehogs. It got to the point where I would stay awake for days straight pushing my bananas through the strings of my guitar and then shaking them out of the hole or shoving bananas through the chicken wire surrounding my hedgehogs. But the banana slices, magnificent as they were, would inevitably end up getting eaten by the hedgehogs or tasting like guitar. From there I began to explore new and dangerous slice methods-methods that would connect me to both the glamorous side of b-slizzling and the deadly underworld of slice addicts.A typical day for me would begin at the banana factory, trading sex or drugs or cash for a fresh batch of newly-minted bananas. Green, yellow, brown-it mattered not. It was all about the slice for me, as any slice addict can attest. From there I would cruise the whittling district with nothing but a knapsack or barrel full of bananas and a bowie knife, selling my flesh to knife artisans for their crafting of slices. But still, the bananas were sliced only to near-perfection, leaving me craving more and better slice every time. I had already been kicked out of every Japanese restaurant from Houston to Chicago for throwing bananas at the chefs to cut in the air. In my insatiable lust for the smooth sensuality of fresh banana slices, I was blind to the racial insensitivity of this practice. I cannot even begin to count the number of kids around town whose bicycles I stole, just to feed my lust for the reckless and dangerous practice of spoke-slicing, or "splicing" as we call it.As I found newer, more efficient-and often ruthless-slizz techniques, I became more and more careless and violent, but still, it was ever enough. I was arrested at home furnishing stores for pushing thousands of bananas through their window blind displays (blindspotting). I was walking around day and night wearing nothing but multi-blade ice skates just to slice the thousands of bananas littering the floor of my home and yard at any given time (figureslicing). I can't tell you how many poor hedgehogs I killed or maimed because of those shoes. I wasted tens of thousands of dollars on designer grade electric and solar-powered fans with razor-sharp blades to accommodate the immense volume of slicing I was pushing on a daily basis (blowing). I always tried to use solar fans to reduce my carbon footprint.Of course this enslaving lifestyle could not be sustained forever. My picture was on the wall of every Benihana in the southwest. Children all over the state had replaced their traditional spoked wheels with solid spokes, and the motocross bullies would turn their bikes on me and beat me senseless when I would stand alongside the supercross track shoving b into their frenzied wheel-spinning (motoring). On October 3rd, 2007, I had hit rock bottom. I had just slizzed with Sean and Biggie in the Hamptons (he's still alive, turning tricks for b in the banana underworld). I awoke from a potassium coma to find my bank account, formerly over twenty million dollars, completely dry. Everybody talked about the housing and equities markets crashing, but let me tell you, the crisis hit the slicers bad!. My credit cards were all cut off, and my lines of credit with the banks and various banana slicing venture capitalists were dry. And the hedgehogs had revolted in a bloody uprising, known as The Bloody Hedgehog Uprising.As I write to you today, from the comfort of my humble country cottage, I do so giving grace to god, with sorrow and gratitude to those whose lives I crushed and those who stood by me through all the finger cuts and slipping on peels. I have found a tranquil peace, all thanks to the hundreds of amazing, beautiful people who made the H-5 a reality.I will skip the platitudes so pervasive in all the reviews of this magnificent product and cut to the chase. CUT TO THE CHASE. That's what the H-5 does. I call it the H-5 for short and because H-5 sounds almost as awesome as the H-5 is. Who knew that I could find peace from such a complex, yet simple, engineering marvel. You would think that I would have had to walk away cold-turkey, but for me, the game was all about the perfect slice. You see, once you find the perfect slice, your life is at peace. And that is what I have found-what I find every day-the perfect slice. Although my H-5 background check revealed to many illicit banana incidents in the past to procure one legally, I was able to receive a presidential pardon from George Bush because he knows I could blow the whistle on his falsified reports on Saddam's WMB's (Wildly Massive B-Slicers) and from Barack Obama because of the help I offered in getting Obamaslice to the socialists.So kids, understand that banana slicing is not as glamorous as all those billboards in the 70s portrayed it, and can be done in a safe and fun manner from your own home for under five dollars. I sincerely hope that the scientists and board members of Hutzler continue forward and attack similar cancers on humanity like methamphetamines, aids and immigration. So much gratitude goes to Anthony Weiner for bringing bananas into the public eye and to Fox News for having the conviction to doggedly pursue this story in hopes of bringing down the banana-controlled senate. May you all experience the joy and frivolity of the H-571. Peace and love to all.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TJI9PX0NVOD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TJI9PX0NVOD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-John:PERSON, 	-Belushi:PERSON, 	-Lindsay:PERSON, 	-Lohan:PERSON, 	-Kelly:PERSON, 	-George:PERSON, 	-Bush:PERSON, 	-Barack:PERSON, 	-Obama:PERSON, 	-Keith:PERSON, 	-Richards-I:PERSON, 	-Chris:PERSON, 	-Farley:PERSON, 	-Green:PERSON, 	-Houston:LOCATION, 	-Chicago:LOCATION, 	-Benihana:ORGANIZATION, 	-Sean:PERSON, 	-Biggie:PERSON, 	-George:PERSON, 	-Bush:PERSON, 	-Saddam:PERSON, 	-Barack:PERSON, 	-Obama:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Anthony:PERSON, 	-Weiner:PERSON, 	-Fox:ORGANIZATION, 	-News:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">I would have given this item 5 stars except it did not come with a USB cable.  Folks it's 2012 almost 2013 and I can't believe someone is selling a product that does not come with a USB cable!I know what you're saying...  USB is outdated by HDMI.  Sure HDMI would be nice but a basic USB connection works just fine.  I don't want to ask for too much.Other than that, this item is GREAT.  It's freezer safe, dishwasher safe, can be washed in hot and cold water, contains no metal so I could take it with me when I visit my family in prison.Another great feature that I love is when you're not in the mood to eat a banana, you can use this as a stencil to draw a banana.  Stripes and all!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38OYXUKCI9YE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38OYXUKCI9YE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I give this product 2 stars.  The description does not say so, but the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, unlike other Hutzler BS models, lacks iPhone integration.Not sure if this was just a design oversight, a deliberate effort by Hutzler to marginalize Apple's profits, or just a reflection of the natural animosity between Apple and Banana.At any rate, after multiple calls to the Hutzler I.T. department went nowhere (high call volume), I came up with my own work-around.  Here's what you need to do:1) Balance the two ends of the 571 Banana Slicer on two soup cans.  (Campbell's "Double Noodle" works best -- Do NOT use Minestrone)2) Place your cereal bowl between the soup cans.3) Place peeled banana on top of the 571 Banana Slicer.  (Banana MUST be pre-peeled.  Will NOT work if you wait to peel it later, per my results on several tries!)4) Place iPhone flush with the 571 over the banana and apply downward pressure, uniformly, keeping the iPhone flat.If you do this correctly, the banana will be forced through the 571 Banana Slicer by the force of the iPhone.  Many of the slices will land in your cereal bowl.  Switch your iPhone to the "spoon" app and enjoy!This work-around makes the 571 usable despite the lack of iPhone integration, but all in all it may be better appreciated by those with smart phones running Android.The 571 is still worth every penny, even for iPhone users, since the technique above will allow you to get perfectly sliced bananas with a lot less pulp sticking in the grooves and buttons than the "old" way of slicing bananas with your iPhone.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PXKS4CFIX8YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PXKS4CFIX8YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Apple:ORGANIZATION, 	-Apple:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Campbell:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Having been raised by Peruvian gorillas after my parents died in a shipwreck in 1974, I think it's safe to say I know a thing or two about banana-slicing.  Or at least, I thought I did.You see, last Thursday I received the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer as a gift from my Uncle Lawrence. He knows that due to my upbringing, I've developed banana-PEELING skills far superior to most of my peers, but as we've all learned--many of us the hard way--banana SLICING is a whole different ballgame.  It's like comparing tee-ball to the major leagues, or a chicken nugget to Coq au vin.  In other words--good luck, buddy.The first thing you'll notice is that the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer looks remarkably like a banana (unlike the Hutzler 570, which was a purple dodecahedron.) The sleek new design really gives it that authentic "banana feel," which is exactly what I'm looking for in a banana slicer. In fact, it looks so authentic I've almost eaten it by mistake four different times.  Whether you need your bananas sliced for cereal, smoothies, pancakes, or more cereal, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer will help you get the job done in a "nanner-second"!I think one of the most intuitive features of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer (our tribe calls it the "Hutz" or "The 571" for short) is that, while it's small enough to fit in almost any standard three-car garage, it's big enough to tackle even the meatiest, most genetically modified steroid-banana.Bottom line:  If you're anything like me, you're a busy man or woman who eats dozens of bananas several times each day. The absolute LAST thing you have time for is opening drawers and fishing out knives.  The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer didn't just make my breakfast easier--it enriched my life beyond my wildest dreams.  I've become a better husband, father, and overall human being.  I can run faster, jump higher, and last longer in bed, and it's all thanks to the patented German engineering of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. If you're in the market for something that will do exactly the thing it says on the box and also turn your entire life around, look no further than the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OKCSQ2NYCYUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OKCSQ2NYCYUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Lawrence:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkGreen;">Thank you Buddha for this amazing product. I only purchased it just for the very sole purpose of being able to write a review. Besides being the coolest white elephant gift giver, I also became quickly known to my townspeople as 'the Woman who slices perfect bananas.' Its a very well respected skill in my town.This product also has helped me eat more bananas, shop for bananas every 3 days to keep them in the perfect stages of ripeness and the shape for my tool which in turn gave me purpose in life. I also gained a few pounds with the extra sugar and it seemed to go to my booty , so this product is also a booty enhancer, wow, who knew?My experimentation in bananas has lead me to make banana fosters and that has brandy in it to flambé' so I also keep brandy in my house and that makes me warm and happy too. I like bananas and liquor. I like to use my slicer in the mid morning when the sun is just peeking Into my kitchen windows ,after my coffee ,before my lunch....I peel a banana, slice it in one easy push down of the tool, then I think...self? what should I do with these even, yellow slices? Then I brainstorm ways to use the slices in sandwiches, smoothies, rice cakes, on toast, in cereal,in oats, in my foster or in the freezer for later days. It's endless.I don't have a pet monkey but this slicer has opened my mind to the idea.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30JIF1DJ7MOPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30JIF1DJ7MOPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Buddha:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">What can be said that hasn’t been already stated about the miracle that is the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer? This product will take care of all of those pesky, difficult, hard-to-slice curved yellow fruits and will surely satisfy any buyer. The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer will be a wonderful addition to any kitchen, dorm room, or place of residence.Safety and ConvenienceI, personally, found myself frustrated and fed up trying to slice bananas each day. There was always something else to do, whether it was taking out the trash, bathing the cat, or doing schoolwork. Slicing bananas was always the last thing on my to-do list because of the great frustration it caused me. Knives are too dangerous and scary, and they might slip on the banana! The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, however, makes cutting bananas a breeze! With its intuitive design, one can simply peel banana they desire to cut, place the banana on the cutting board, line up the Hutzler with the banana, and press down to cut through the banana. Rather than taking anywhere from thirty seconds to a minute or more to cut a single banana, this task can now be accomplished in less than ten seconds! Talk about a lifesaver!Child-FriendlyDid I mention this utensil is also child-friendly? Any child will love using this to slice their favorite curved yellow fruit for a desirable and well-earned snack! Much safer than conventional knives, and easier to use than a katana, kids will once again come to love slicing bananas in real life more than on an iPad!Machine WashableThe Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is also dishwasher safe, so you will not have to worry about cleaning all of the nasty banana gunk off the utensil. No more gross banana hands for this guy, or for anyone who owns this product! Simply finish slicing the desired bananas, rinse the Banana Slicer in the sink, and place it in the dishwasher; after running it through the cycle with the rest of your dishes, your Banana Slicer will come out good as new and ready to use.Non-toxicFinally, for anyone concerned about BPAs and personal health, one need not worry about this kitchen contraption! While other kitchen products may be composed of dangerous plastics and other materia1ls, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is BPA free. This provides peace of mind so you can slice bananas to your heart’s content and know that you are using a family-friendly and safe product.In SummaryThe Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is a product that will add value to anyone’s kitchen. With its sheer convenience, a-peel-ing design, family-friendly function, and BPA free construction, this banana slicer will solve your fruit-cutting calamity and will free up your schedule to allow you to get back to the things in your life that really need your attention.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IXX4I3FLKQ3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IXX4I3FLKQ3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-BPA:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">Move over sliced bread! Who needs you when we can bulk up on potassium!?  The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer gives hope to a seemingly hopeless world. Dreams really do come true when long bananas can be separated into up to 17 separate sections! I daresay that if this product would have been invented sooner; the titanic would not have sunk, the cold war would have been lukewarm, and Cain probably wouldn't have killed Abel.  If such a marvel like this can be invented by mere man, I have faith in the future to come.  What more can be built that has had the way paved by such a phenomenon!?  As a wise man once said, "Bad analogies are like a banana in a sword fight" well I suspect that no such sword fight would have taken place over a well made banana split.  This artifact wakes me up in the morning, stops children from crying, and shines like the yellow sun in the shape of a crescent moon. Buy it. Love it. Live.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BZZBTG0HIQLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BZZBTG0HIQLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Cain:PERSON, 	-Abel:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I was recently on a sight seeing tour deep in the Amazon (no relation) when I became separated from my group.  I soon became captured by a hostile tribe of natives, and was sure I was going to become that day's lunch.  I searched my pockets for whatever trinket I might find to buy myself a little time, when I found my Hutzler 571 Banana slicer.  I set up a makeshift demonstration table on a large tree trunk and demonstrated to the tribe's elders the amazing symmetrical banana slicing capabilities of this wonderful device.  fortunately for me the ancient scrolls had predicted that one day a bald, fat, white man would appear with impeccable banana slicing skills and would deliver the tribe from their shabbily sliced banana woes.  I was swept up on the shoulders of the tribesmen and immediately worshiped as a deity.  Unbeknownst to me, there had been a great division in the tribe between those who sliced bananas longways with a machete, and those who squished them up into little balls and served them that way.  I had brought the tribes together and avoided a bloody civil war.  Small children sang ballads about me.  After a few weeks, I made the difficult decision to leave the tribe and find my way back to civilization.  I left the banana slicer at the elder's doorstep and snuck away in the middle of the night.  For three weeks, I battled snakes, leeches and the occasional jaguar to find my way out of the jungle.  The worse part of the ordeal was having to survive on unevenly shaped banana slices.  I have now made my way back home and will definitely be ordering myself a second Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30W5MV14HLQS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30W5MV14HLQS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">The product description says the Hutzler 571 is great for cereal, but out of the box, it's not.  I'm a huge Rice Krispie fan and the crisped rice grains simply fell through the slots, and I was left trying to lick the grains that are stuck to the cross-bars like an idiot.  It's a far less efficient cereal-eating tool than the fork I had been using, owing to the fork's more strategic prong placement (the prongs are much closer together on the fork, so few if any grains fall through).I ended up wrapping the Hutzler in plastic wrap, and it works much better, but for $2.51 you'd think that modifications wouldn't be necessary.It gains a star because I'm sure it would work great with larger-grained cereals like the Chex series and Corn Puffs.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SL0LJC9PYDBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3SL0LJC9PYDBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Rice:PERSON, 	-Krispie:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">While this product was above average in some respects (it did a perfectly serviceable job slicing bananas), it was almost useless for peeling grapes.  Why wouldn't Hutzler ensure that it could do both, knowing full well that nobody eats bananas without grapes?  I'm happy to give it 3 stars because of the fine craftsmanship, but they are going to have to address this grape peeling issue if they want to earn four - or if they can handle peeling AND slicing the grapes, perhaps I could see my way clear to 5.  I've sent Hutzler a strongly-worded letter from my lawyers and will update this group if I hear back from them.  Otherwise, I will have to go forward with a $10,000,000 suit against them.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN8CGYW0H7O6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN8CGYW0H7O6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Love this product, however, I'm refrained of using it on the field because it is too bright.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Upon arrival, I must confess, I thought the whole idea useless. "A bananna slicer?" That's why we have Esmerelda." And indeed, the entire household looked with some disdain at the little yellow tines. My son, during a fit of insomnia, searched the house for a bookmark, finally settling on the Hutzler 571 as the perfect accessory to keep his literary place intact. We thought the matter settled.We hemmed and hawed over the poor performance our house workers displayed when creating our fruit salad, our crepes, our banannas Foster. Irregular and lumpy, the slices just didn't make the mark. Gurtzenhulu, (my son,) frustrated by the ugly fruit, once slammed down his book, sending the Hutzler flying from between the pages. It hung in the air, rotating as though suspended, before coming down perfectly upon a peeled banana sitting on the cutting board. As if by magic, seeing the 18 perfect pieces lying there, framed by the yellow cutting tool, we gasped as though struck. It was my wife, Marphlezik, who screamed first."Banana sliced perfectly, oh my gracious gracious gracious gracious, oh my!!! Peabody, come and lookeee!!"  She called to our daughter.  Peabody come a runnin' and we marveled at the wonder of it all. "Oh muh gawd, purty little slices sliced like slices!" Peabody gurggled, stuffing each banana partition in her slotted, barely toothed mouth. Little bits of 'nana spilt from betwixt her lips. A chunk lodged in my eye. Through the tears, I saw the wobbly figures of my family transformed into a happy party marred only by indentured servitude.Well done, Huzler. Well done.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDXR7CWF3X7SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDXR7CWF3X7SW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Esmerelda:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Gurtzenhulu:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Marphlezik:PERSON, 	-Huzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">Thanks to this not so amazing product our family banana slicer is without a job. He was brought to the USA from all the way in the jungles of Guatemala. His whole life he was trained in the art of banana slicing. Since birth, Don Plantain as he was affectionately called, had been slicing bananas all over the world until we hired him for good. His methods were beyond exceptional. Who knew that a cheap flimsy piece of plastic would put him out of a job? I for sure never saw it coming. I don't think anybody did. The Banana Slicers of Guatemala are now becoming a thing of the past. Soon they will be forgotten. And we all owe it to the Hutzler Banana Slicer. Next time you decide to buy one for yourself or your loved ones make sure you thank those that came before this product. Those that instead of learning how to take their first baby steps were learning how to slice their first banana for our selfish purposes.Damn you, Hutzler. Damn you.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M62RMI6HLCAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M62RMI6HLCAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-USA:LOCATION, 	-Guatemala:LOCATION, 	-Don:PERSON, 	-Plantain:PERSON, 	-Guatemala:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

This saves a lot of time as I assemble the crepes by hand to the customers specifications, while they wait.  My only complaint about this gadget, (hence the 4 stars) -- the slices are a bit thicker than I would like.  It would be nicer to have lots of thin slices, rather than several thick slices.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">My dog ate chocolate out of the garbage and died. Then my house burned down due to an exploding potato. My wife left me because she had no home and no potato. I then got hit by a car while mowing the lawn. I saw the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer on Amazon and ordered it (to a PO Box, because I had no house) because of the Amazon reviews. I received the box with such glee that I tripped on a brick step and broke my ankle. Turns out the brick was loose because of a safe deposit box key was left under it. After weeks of searching the internet (on wireless, because I had no house), I found the bank the key belonged to. In this bank, a box full of bearer bonds and a small bag of cocaine. I quickly snorted the cocaine and cashed in the bearer bonds. Today, I am a billionaire software developer with an amazing banana slicer that slices bananas pretty well. I recommend this product. I still don't have a house, though.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KL5TZJW68QH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KL5TZJW68QH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">When I first saw this product, I felt a euphoric sense of relief, thinking a life-long problem had been resolved.  But instead of salvation, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has brought me nothing but bitter frustration and despondency.Before I go any further, I would like to voice my objection to the obviously euphemistic and wholly inappropriate product description on the Amazon page - "Kids love slicing their own bananas".  Really, Hutzler?  You left out, "Nudge, nudge, wink, wink!"  Shame on you.Now, I should point out that I have benefitted from other banana-assistive technology.  I have been using the Apogee Banana Peeler BPX52Z for several years.  But this product, effective as it is, as far as it goes, leaves the user with a still-intact fruit dog.  What to do?  So, after years of having to throw away hundreds of unsliced (and therefore, obviously inedible) bananas, along comes Hutzler to the rescue.  I knew I must have this technological marvel, no matter what the cost.After months living a Spartan existence and saving every penny, I finally amassed enough money to cover the purchase price.  When the box finally arrived at my door, I was so elated that I kissed the UPS driver.  On the lips.  Needless to say, I was happy and excited.  I was glad to get my banana slicer, too.After gleefully tearing through the packing materials, I was shocked to discover that my 571 came with no, I repeat, NO instruction manual.  How the hell am I supposed to figure this out myself?!  Hey Hutzler - not everyone is a University of Phoenix graduate, you know?Fortunately, my next door neighbor has a Spider monkey, Peanut, who was able to demonstrate proper operation of this device.  So, great - all that ends well is well, right?  Not this time.As mentioned, intentionally or not, no instruction manual was included.  Nonetheless, I've mastered the slicing procedure (thanks to Peanut).  But now, how do I get the freshly-sliced fruit disks from the plate to my mouth?  I've asked Peanut to show me, but he always puts them in HIS mouth, which does me no good.Does Hutzler also offer a Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance System?  It is simply cruel to take people half-way there, and then mock them by leaving them helplessly staring at a plate of sweet (I can only assume, of course) slices.By proffering the 571 Banana Slicer, is Hutzler truly attempting to help humanity, or is this nothing more than a sadistic joke, meant to exploit the limitations of human cognition and perseverance, and the fragility of emotion?  Are they part of some nefarious collusive plot, along with Apogee, to drive the human race mad, one banana lover at a time??So what's your deal, Hutzler?  What other instruments of torture do you brutes have in that treacherous treasure trove you call a product line?  Bottomless mugs?  Pencils with erasers on both ends?  Hornet-filled piñatas?  You vicious bastards!While I am grateful for the new relationship that has blossomed with Carl (the UPS guy), no other good has come of this purchase, and l feel Hutzler needs to make this right, not just for me, but for everyone.To all other victims of this mean-spirited chicanery (Chiquitery?), if we do not soon receive satisfaction, I suggest we file a class action suit, to "peel" away the façade, and expose the conspiracy.  This isn't a banana republic.  This is America, dammit!  Let the revolution begin here...Now, then...were the manufacturer to see their way clear to send me one of those Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance Systems for free (WITH INSTRUCTIONS), I'm sure we could put all this ugliness behind us.  The banana's in your court, Hutzler...</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P5DBMPBE17VT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P5DBMPBE17VT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-UPS:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-University:ORGANIZATION, 	-of:ORGANIZATION, 	-Phoenix:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Carl:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-America:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I bought several of these after our Zoo presented wish lists from the animals. There was everything from sugar free Jello(tm) to radios on the list. Yet nothing that seemed to aid in the department of banana eating. After I received my order, I went immediately to the zoo, threw a handful over the fence and exclaimed "JUMANJI".After I made bond, I was informed I was no longer welcome at the zoo. I'd like to think I'm still welcomed by the monkeys since I gave them the best Christmas ever.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32OL6A1B1LHK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32OL6A1B1LHK1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">This 571B Banana Slicer is first in its class.  Although using this tool is a challenge, I hope to perfect my form and improve my speed.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">For years now I have been cursed with the Thanksgiving chore of making the fruit salad, after delicately slicing all the other varieties of fruits It would seem ok! But then came the banana. You'd might call my banana slices "uneven" or "awkward" so much to the extent my family would be so discussed with my slicing performance they would banish me to the corner where I was forced to eat my Thanksgiving dinner alone. Filled with embarrassment I would cry for hours while my cousins would point and laugh at me. I was done for.... Atleast until the 571B Banana Slicer came! With its graceful blade and sexy look, I will never have to worry about lumpy and uneven slices ever again! It works for all sizes! No more eating in the corner for this guy! Now, this thanksgiving I will be filled with approval and get to sit at the grand table where I belong. THANKS BANANA SLICER! YOU NAILED IT!!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MVDM6Y1LVP2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MVDM6Y1LVP2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I must confess that I was more than a little skeptical about this product when it was recommended to me. Our marriage was totally on the rocks. As far as we were concerned, nothing could save us; it was too late. Years of unresolved banana-slicing issues had killed all traces of our love. We had tried counseling, but found that there is NO ONE out there who understands this marriage-killer. "Lighten up! Does it really matter if the banana slices are perfect?" they would flippantly ask. Or, worse: "Isn't your marriage worth spending 10 seconds slicing a sticky banana with a knife?" We could find no help anywhere, and we knew the problem was only going to get worse with time, as we entered our golden years and had to eat more and more bananas to keep our potassium levels up.Well, thanks to all the great reviews, (especially the one from KRWE30 with the very relevant rhetorical question of, "what's the point of even getting married if you can't find a quality banana slicer?"), I decided to check into this new device. I sought advice from trusted friends, and with the support I got from them, I approached my husband. We prayed about it together, and he was finally convinced by the review from Happyhubby with the military endorsement. It was a big decision, but we decided our marriage was worth one more try, and we sprung for the Victoria 571B model. No cheap substitutes; we had too much at stake.Oh. My. Word.I nearly wept with joy after the first use. If you have never had banana-slicing issues, it is hard to understand the difference this humble little tool has made in our marriage. NO more grumbling about slicing bananas, EVER. Now, if you can believe it, we even tease each other about who "gets" to slice them that day, lol, it's so much fun to use it. We have talked about splurging on a second one!Don't wait til it's too late, like we almost did. I see the price has dropped to $5.49. We bought ours when they were $8.50, but we have no regrets; it has been so worth it.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NMZFUPFEQALF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NMZFUPFEQALF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Happyhubby:LOCATION, 	-Victoria:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I'm a man and I'm also a father, and if you watch sitcoms or commercials for household cleaners then you know that I am a complete moron.  It's not my fault though.  I walk through life cursed with these bumbling oven mitt-like dad paws, with this intellect that tells me the best way to eradicate a hornets' nest is to spray it with a garden hose.  For Pete's sake, I electrocuted myself six times last week alone!  My wife started hiding the kitchen knives when I nearly cut off my left middle toe trying to shoot Cap'n Crunch into my mouth using our carving knife as a catapult and our whisk as a fulcrum.  She eighty sixed me from the kitchen altogether when she caught me folding the Wonder Bread into PB&J tacos, thereby concealing the sheen of mold that had grown on one side of each of the slices.  Now I have the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!  I'm still not allowed in the kitchen, but sometimes my wife sets me up in front of the TV with a cutting board, a dozen naners, and one of these babies, and I get to do my part.Redaction - I took off one star after I stepped on it barefoot.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FXZJQ9UEBW5B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FXZJQ9UEBW5B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Pete:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">This is totally a scam -- at least half of my bananas curve towards the left, but this thing only slices right-curving bananas! Could you at least sell them by the pair so we can slice ALL our bananas? I kept ordering them, hoping I will receive a left-curving slicer but no luck. Now I've got 14 right-curving slicers and I'm very frustrated, I may no longer eat bananas in protest.In the end, it may be a time-saver in the kitchen, but then you end up spending twice as long at the grocery store picking out all the right-curving bananas. You end up wasting more time.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N6MBELY8T93B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3N6MBELY8T93B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I can honestly say that this product changed my life. Before I bought the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I used to cut my bananas by stretching my toes apart and smooshing the bananas between them. This method resulted in mooshy slices every time. To make matters worse, my shoes were always filled with banana goo. After a few days, the goo would begin to rot, and the stench would become unbearable. It got to the point where I was buying a new pair of shoes nearly once a week. Thanks to this product, my slices are never mooshy, and I have saved thousands on shoes.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MEW6I0AJ5MNZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MEW6I0AJ5MNZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">OMG.  As a child I was often teased for my poor banana slicing abilities.  My uneven slicing caused me so much grief and anxiety that I was unable to leave my home for the past 20 years and have since lived with my parents.  I earn a meager living working out of my parents' basement reviewing pyrimid schemes for home based businesses and writing warnings about them on various web sites.  Thanks to Facebook, I am able to keep up with the outside world and recently changed by status to "in a relationship" with a one handed lawyer I met in a chat room.  Although we have never met in person we chat every day on FB and even have plans to Skype.  I was up late one night, I usually can't fall asleep easily since I still hear the taunts that were hurled at my growing up about my banana slicing skills.  The children were especially fond of singing "Lucy Lucy you can't slice and you will never ever be a mans wife."  Through my tears I looked up at the television screen and saw the most wonderful product on an informative info mercial.  I was skeptical but desperate.  The days awaiting its arrival were an eternity and I won't lie as sucidal thoughts did cross my mind.  Finally the postman delivered this amazing God send.  I prayed silently before attempting my first banana in over 20 years.  I was also heavily medicated and had prepared myself for dissapointment and another 20 years of living in my parents basement which occasionally floods.  Tears of gratitude flowed from my eyes as I sliced the much despised yellow fruit.  "Shock" is the only word that can describe the results as I stared in disbelief at the perfect slices.  Yes, I said "PERFECT" slices.  The years of outrage at practically being held prisioner by a crippling fear of leaving the house the sun, which I hadn't felt in ages on my skin, blinded me I triupantly yelled "How do you like me now bitch! Suck it."</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23CYOKMO21NVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23CYOKMO21NVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Facebook:ORGANIZATION, 	-Skype:ORGANIZATION, 	-Lucy:PERSON, 	-Lucy:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I bought the Hutzler 571 as a joke for my cousin.  Months ago he had shown a picture of it on his Facebook page with a caption reading, "This is the best thing ever invented"..  I thought he was joking as he has a really cool and slightly off-beat sense of humor.  Seeing that I'm the crazy, but silent one, I thought it would be so funny to buy it and send it to him anonymously.  No one would suspect ME of doing anything like that and it would be so much fun watching him try to figure out who would send him an anonymous package with a banana slicer inside.  HE LOVED IT!  With great timing, the package arrived on a day where he had just spent a few hours at the emergency room for a badly sprained ankle. He was in lots of pain and depressed about the day so, finding a package when he got home was a little boost. His wife took a picture of him holding it and  put it on his Facebook page!  It was soooo funny reading the story of his crappy day and seeing a picture of him holding up his anonymously sent banana slicer, especially knowing that I was the one who had sent it to him!!  In the comments section I slyly asked "what the heck IS that thing in the picture" and he told me all about how great it was and that I should really read the reviews on Amazon!!!  LOLOL, that was a month ago and he still has no clue it was me who sent it.  This is too much fun. I'm going to keep this up for a long time!  Just hope he doesn't read this review!  Oh, and BTW, I hear that the slicer works great!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXEMN5J1UN78M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXEMN5J1UN78M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-LOLOL:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">A most excellent product that has been a godsend for my wife, myself, and our 16 children for many years. Unfortunately some of the kids have already been lobbying to be awarded this beloved family heirloom after my wife and I pass on to the great beyond. We have spent tens of thousands of dollars on lawyers writing and re-writing our will in the futile effort to come to some fair arrangement. It looks like we'll end up auctioning this item and evenly splitting the proceeds amongst our heirs.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUJSWK10JHUJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUJSWK10JHUJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Like most of you, I had been using the ax method to slice my bananas in the morning. After losing the third toe, I switched to the lesser known but still highly regarded sledgehammer approach. While this certainly worked, I think calling the result "slices" is a bit misleading at best. And then there was the fourth toe lost....What to do? My hacksaw couldn't make a dent in them, and child services put a stop to the 4 year old using the metal bandsaw even though the re-attachment surgery was completely successful! I came on Amazon to purchase an acetylene cutting torch, but I came across this product, and the rest is history!On to the performance: now when I hit the banana with the sledgehammer instead of turning into mush it is cleanly sliced into the perfect cereal topping. No more mush and floor dirt! Since I've switched to a smaller 8lb sledgehammer the banana slicer lasts for up to 3 times before I have to replace it!Cleanup couldn't be easier. All you need is something like a toothbrush, and in less than 5 minutes of careful scrubbing between each blade it is clean and ready for tomorrow. And if it broke, you just toss it in the trash and save yourself the time, though I always sleep a little better if spend a few minutes getting the worst bits out. Then you just fill up a bucket with water and ammonia, mop the floor to remove the remnants, and then dry it with paper towels so the kids don't slip and fall. Finally, run the sledgehammer under the sink to wash it off, then lightly oil it to prevent it from rusting.This is a miracle product that has changed our lives forever. I cannot imagine an easier way to prepare a banana for human consumption. Bananas used to be a luxury item, something we ate on special Sundays when we had the time to both prepare them and make the trip to the emergency room. Now, so long as I have a spare 10-15 minutes, it's banana time!  I've even started a little side business preparing bananas for the neighbors, which to be honest is more a labor of love. Once I get the 10 ton press I'll be able to scale this up into a money making operation, as I could probably slice 10-15 bananas at once. I dream of a future where any middle-class American has access to a well sliced banana. Thanks to Hutzler, that day is a little closer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L1GQAIIY6VFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L1GQAIIY6VFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">After hearing about this from a friend I thought I would give it a try. I have been walking my dog for years and have always had to pick up after her. She's a big Labrador retriever so let's just say the baggies are pretty awkwardly full at the end of the walk. That was until now. This little gem of a turd cutter allows the "longer lawn logs" to be minimized into a much more managable, bag-able size! Don't leave home walking your pooch without one! I also suggest having second one just in case. I use the ankle holster for the backup.Pros: Can be used as an alarm clock.Cons: Could not get batteries to stay in correctly.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R284EV7PQS7VMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R284EV7PQS7VMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Labrador:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">This product brought joy and equality to our office banana party! We were at a real pickle due to a scheduling error, and did not have enough bananas for all the banana party attendees. Fortunately, one of our coworkers had this wonderful Banana Slicer® in his back pocket. We were able to split® the banana into equal amount of slices for all the attendees. This experience goes to show that you just never know when you might need a Banana Slicer®. Get it now, because it will be too late when you need it.Also a good tip from an avid user; make sure to never wash it after use. This product is like an old Chinese (no offense) tea pot. The residue from the previous use adds to the taste of the sliced® banana.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09FFNtLO8iY</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29WVOGDOVIFV1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29WVOGDOVIFV1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I love this product, however, I find that it cuts the banana into way too many slices.. I find that sometimes I'm simply not that hungry.. It would be better if it were adjustable to maybe cut the banana into maybe 6 or 8 pieces. I can eat those easy..but 18?? I'm not sure anyone could eat THAT many pieces.. On a good note, they sent me the reversible model, so I can cut both right and left bending bananas. I just thought it cut the ones that bet to the right... #HappyMonkey</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROELF03O1Y2VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROELF03O1Y2VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">There is nothing a child loves more than slicing their own banana. This is an irrefutable fact of science.The problem has always been, "How do they do it? What do they use?" Given their lack of knowledge, it was notuncommon to see a child hacking away at a banana with a spoon for hours on end, until their tears wiped the mashedpulp of their once proud fruit off the cutting board of their shattered dreams.Even worse, more adventurous children would resort to power tools. I've lost count of the number of state wardsI've lost to banana cutting related accidents in my wood shop. You might say "why don't you keep those orphansout of your woodshop?", but that is ridiculous, because I need their tiny, skillful fingers to craft the woodendowels that keep up my extravagant, banana rich lifestyle.Thankfully, the Banana Slicer solves all these problems! It is a marvel of modern science, and if onlyit could also peel the banana, I could completely prevent the loss of orphan limbs to belt sanders. Godbless you Hutzler. God bless us every one.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTNHFOXEFUVBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTNHFOXEFUVBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I tried all 570 of Hutzler's previous banana slicers but I can definitely say they've nailed it with the 571. They've finally gotten the shape right after the embarrassing 138, which was really shaped like an apple, the 390 which was backwards and, of course, the legendarily phallic 560. The cutting power of the blades is also perfect. No more cancer from their experiment with gamma rays. No more destroyed desks from their banana "lightslicer". Just simple plastic that can cut through any banana, no matter how raw. The pinnacle of banana slicing technology has finally arrived!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSY9NMU807BXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSY9NMU807BXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">I purchased this product for a right-hand dominant pregnant friend who recently found herself in a terrible dilemma one early morning.  It seems her unborn baby was craving a banana for breakfast.  Unfortunately, the expectant mother was experiencing pregnancy induced carpal tunnel in her right hand which rendered the hand absolutely useless (in a related side note, she also specifically refers to this uncontrollable hand as “The Claw!” from the movie Liar Liar).  How was she supposed to cut and eat this banana the Claw she wondered?  So began the process of trial and error.  The banana was ripe, so she was able to “claw” the fruit and bash it on the edge of the counter to get the peel to break open.  But then she dropped it on the kitchen floor on account of useless Claw, but was able to pick it up with her left hand.  After it was skinned, she attempted to use a steak knife (that she stole from a nearby five star steakhouse) with her left hand to slice it into equal 1/4” wide slices.  But her luck just couldn't improve—it was a right-handed knife! Being in a bit of an exhausted rage, she threw the banana into the a Magic Bullet and made a banana mash.  According to the mother, that’s not what the baby ordered!  I gave her the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer product the day after the incident (Amazon Prime Free Two-Day Shipping delivered in only one day!) and it solved all of her life’s problems.  The mother and baby lived happily ever after!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GLCL9F236VQV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GLCL9F236VQV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Prime:ORGANIZATION, 	-Free:ORGANIZATION, 	-Two-Day:ORGANIZATION, 	-Shipping:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">While it does cut bananas, the ad says that kids will enjoy slicing their own bananas too.  I bought this so that my kids would have something else to do, other than play video games.  I even invested in a couple bunches of bananas to encourage their new hobby (a waste of money, as we don't eat fruit).  To my disappointment, they couldn't have cared less.  When I inquired about other kids at school who have taken up "nanner slicin'" (probably what the kids are calling it), my sons just laughed at me and replied that slicing bananas is "lame".  I didn't want to throw the bananas away unsliced, so I sliced them all myself- it was quite exhilarating.  But, I specifically purchased this as a means to provide my kids with an extra curricular activity, and maybe turn their grades around and get them off of pot.  For failing my children I give it 3 stars!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MTHQSQAQDV7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MTHQSQAQDV7K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I have said it once and I will say it again: there is nothing more infuriating than an improperly sliced banana. I’m a busy person and stressful, hectic mornings are not unusual to me; so taking the time out of my morning routine to ensure an evenly-sliced banana is often out of the question.Every morning I wake up at exactly 5:40 am to my Trans-Siberian Orchestra alarm, hop out of my futon and get dressed in the Pinterest-inspired pantsuit that I laid out the night before. Once I’m dressed I prepare breakfast for myself and Admiral Spikes-a-lot, my 3-month-old cactus that I’ve attached googly eyes to. And, well, that’s when my mornings become complicated. I’m often faced with the Sophie’s-choice-esque decision between suffering through the packing-peanut-crunch of plain, off-brand Cheerios or spending the necessary time to properly slice and distribute my banana into my breakfast; a feat that always leaves me three hours late for work at my terriers-only dog groomery.However, thanks to this innovative product, I have been able to add a perfectly sliced banana to my cereal EVERY DAY with ease, as well as only a 0.1 – 0.2 mm margin of error. I now have so much time in my morning routine that I have begun to take up knitting! I have so far made infinity scarves for eight of my eleven garden gnomes! The only complaint that comes to mine is that I can only purchase a 10-inch slicer online when many of the bananas I encounter at my local grocer are much more varied in size- I’d love some smaller and larger slicers as well so that I can have more variation in my banana sizes at breakfast. Other than that, this product has been a life saver and I have recommended it to everyone I know!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LG0Q3UGHDVJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LG0Q3UGHDVJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Sophie:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">Long have I labored in the dismal trenches of humanity, squandering my labor on tawdry devices that proclaim to make life simpler, when, in fact, all they do is create a gaping maw of hopeless despair. Day in and day out, year in and year out, I bought into the lie, automating each and every facet of my life. Take, for instance, the 'simple' action of slicing a banana. For years I coveted some device that could make this begruding task simpler, and upon gaining the ranks of adulthood, I finally acquired the one tool that could provide me the simplicity I needed to cut my bananas: the Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf ShredderPatriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder. Power, speed and immortality were now at the cusp of my intention, and I knew that I had finally arrived.But with age comes experience, and with experience, wisdom. I soon realized the addiction to unleaded gasoline I had developed. The fear of being unable to cut my own bananas with such ease crept through my soul like the malignant cancer it was. Therapy was no help, and the pills did nothing to quiet the cacophony of voices screaming for sanity in my head. I began to purchase larger and larger gasoline containers in the hope that I would have enough gasoline on hand should I forget my daily trip to 7-11 for a donut and a slushie. 5 gallons became 10, 10 became 100, and soon the ATF was at my doorstep demanding the removal of the second 10,000 gallon gasoline tank I had just finished installing in my backyard (made all the more difficult by the fact that I do not support The Man by linking my domicile to electricity or water). They claimed the judge agreed with them. They claimed the city agreed with them. Fools, could they not see the predicament, nay, the impending doom that silently waited the moment when I could no longer cut My BANANAS!Living in a society so decrepit, so corrupt, so filled with its own ambition that the only possible outcome is it's own demise is not an easy thing with which to live. It was obvious to me and mine that these attempts at preparation were doomed to failure, and so the stage was set. These gasoline haters were the harbingers of the apocalypse, one which I could not avoid without endangering my own ability to cut bananas with my Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder. I slipped into depression, a black hole from which I knew no escape existed. I was destined to a life living in fear of the days when I would be forced, through sheer survival, to attempt eating a banana without it being cut. I ask the reader to forgive the vivid imagery, and I fully understand if you must leave now to quiet the wailing grief of the women and children, those who cannot bear such a thought.Behold, I have been vindicated! I have been released from such a death grip on my soul! Now, thanks to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I have found a way to continue cutting my bananas long after mankind has ceased to suckle at the teat of fossil fuel dependence. I will preserve my precious Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the vault, where it will stand ready for all of my banana cutting needs. Gas powered appliances have their place in every modern kitchen, and the usefulness of such a treasure from the Gods will not go unused.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Boy, is my face red!  I purchased the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, mistakenly thinking I was getting the Hustler 571.  My husband was in so much pain he couldn't remember the safe word and we spent a really embarrassing night in the ER.  While he was healing, I did try it on some bananas, and it worked great for that.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P1M8YLFNZZ00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P1M8YLFNZZ00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I was very excited when my banana slicer came in the mail as it was the perfect gift for this old dinosaur I know!  His eyes have never been happier than the moment he unwrapped this unique and thoughtful present to realize he would never have a knife accidentally slip off a banana and slice his hand again.  However, a week later he called me quite upset about the performance of his banana slicer.  Being a Dinosaur he purchases special boneless bananas to make eating easier on his old jaws and this banana slicer does NOT work with boneless bananas.  I wish I would have enquired into this before purchasing, maybe it would have saved a Dinosaur some tears.  So be warned.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GP675YHCZV0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GP675YHCZV0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Wow, what can I say? Amidst the turbulent times in which we live it is easy to become pessimistic. Every day our news feeds are filled with more horrific events leaving us wondering what could possibly happen next. It is a rare occasion that you find something which can help you rise above the chaos and see that there is goodness left in the world. This product is one of those things. My faith in humanity is restored. It is so very refreshing to see that there are still those who see a desperate need in our global community and rise to the challenge of fulfilling it. Never again will humanity struggle with the hapless and near impossible task of slicing bananas with a knife. We have truly reached the age of enlightenment.As a sociologist I am often asked what innovation I predict as defining the 21st century, smart-phones, social media, the Kardashians? I can now say with total conviction that our century will be known by posterity as the dawn of the Hutzler 571 Banana slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23BWA95TBLW74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23BWA95TBLW74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Kardashians:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I'm sitting here, bawling like a baby, after receiving my Hutzler Banana Slicer.  You see, my grandmother died 17 years ago.  For at least 20 years prior to her death, my grandma ate Corn Flakes with sliced bananas on it for breakfast every single morning.  On her deathbed, she grabbed my hand and said "Barbara, if only....if only I hadn't had to slice those bananas every morning, I could have had a few more years!  Slicing those darn bananas took years off my life!  You--my brilliant granddaughter--you must invent something that will slice the bananas so as to give other seniors a few more years--years I wish I still had!  You must do it!"Well, as I am still grieving the loss of my grandmother, I have been unable to work on inventing something to slice bananas.  Imagine my surprise to find that it had been invented--thus saving me the time-consuming process of designing, engineering, acquiring a patent, all of that stuff. Thank you Hutzler!I have ordered two cases of these wonderful items.  My parents will now have more time left...time they won't have to spend slicing bananas over their cereal.  I plan on ordering more of them to take to the senior villages around here and distributing them (I live in Florida, we have an overabundance or seniors down here).  Once I get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the hands of every senior citizen in Florida, I will work on younger populations.  This product could, conceivably, add years to the average persons' lifespan.  It could also result in more money in Hutzler's pocket, as I am sure once folks start using the right-handed slicer, they will want to order the left-handed slicer.For years I have been searching for my mission in life.  Distributing the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to senior citizens, I now believe, is my calling.  If I can save even ONE grandchild the grief I have experienced at my grandmother losing years--YEARS!!--of her life due to having to slice bananas then it will be worthwhile.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ICKEHZRETQPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ICKEHZRETQPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Barbara:PERSON, 	-Florida:LOCATION, 	-Florida:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Reading through some of these reviews I became incredibly excited knowing that my days of endless karate chopping and sword slicing would be over. But I must tell u that this product is not as good as the reviews say it is. It is not a life changing experience, it is not a product that will save your marriage. No, sadly, it is not even a product that can get u an A in ur AP Chemistry class either. No, this is much much much more than that. This isn't a product to save your marriage, it is a product to save the human race. Before this incredible feat of scientific and engineering innovation, we were mere apes, pealing and eating our bands with our hands. Now today, I am proud to say, that with this modern breakthrough we now advance in the human evolution process as we can now eat bananas with utensils like never before. Before this product I tried using a knife, but I always seemed to slice off my fingers, one time losing 3 to a horrific strawberry banana smoothie accident. After I received this monumental creation for a simple payment of $4.06 including tax, I am glad to report that after 4 uses, and 4 smoothies, I still have my thumb and middle finger left! Overall If I were to guess, this product was conjured up by some wizard at MIT college university, and truly is the best thing since Hutzler's 570 apple corer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J20BDJ73IJIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J20BDJ73IJIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-MIT:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I am a man on the go. I will just say I spend my nights on top of buildings prowling the streets of my crime ridden home town. I sometimes get in scuffles with psychopaths and need a pick me up afterward. Bananas have always been my number one fruit. They supply the appropriate amount of potassium I need to defeat evil-doers. I stay light weight on my stake outs and don't have a pocket to stick my beloved bananas in. So, I have gone with out for years. I have never been truly happy. Until...the Victorio Kitchen 571B Banana Slicer was released! I had my butler purchase one for me and I can't remember a time when I was more happy. Each slice fits perfectly into my utility belt. So whenever I'm hanging above a vat of acid thinking of an escape plan or growling at a middle man to give me the name of his boss, I can enjoy a quick bite of banana bliss. So to any chaos causing clowns, fear flinging fiends or Bane, beware the Bat is now powered with the proper amount if vitamins needed to take you down. Thank you Victorio, you are not the banana slicer I deserved, but the banana slicer I needed.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V03QLP0ZR4OB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V03QLP0ZR4OB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Victorio:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">This is by far the best thing that's happened in my life since President Bush retired to Dallas - and I'm not just saying that because I live in Houston.  I had been using my Milwaukee 6538-21 15.0 Amp Super Sawzall Reciprocating Saw (Milwaukee 6538-21 15.0 Amp Super Sawzall Reciprocating Saw) for banana slicing, but I always found myself breaking blades at inopportune times.  There was also the hassle of slicing through the Formica counter and into my thigh or abdomen, causing an unexpected delay in eating breakfast due to the need to mop up blood and/or entrails.  The Hutzler 571 was a Godsend - in fact, I am debating buying several hundred of them and sending them to the Tea Party so that they could use them to help in preserving American liberty; however, when I Google Tea Party I see multiple entries and they all seem to want money instead of banana slicers.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S1S4R1CTQU81/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S1S4R1CTQU81/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Bush:PERSON, 	-Dallas:LOCATION, 	-Houston:LOCATION, 	-Milwaukee:LOCATION, 	-Milwaukee:LOCATION, 	-Formica:ORGANIZATION, 	-Tea:ORGANIZATION, 	-Party:ORGANIZATION, 	-Google:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">going too ripe and waiting to be sliced.  At least, not since I purchased this handy-dandy slicer when I saw it on special for under $3 including s/h.Nowadays, as soon as I see a few brown spots, I just zip off the peel, press this nifty tool over the banana, and freeze my sliced bananas for use in smoothies, cereals, what-have-you.  And, it's easy to remove the slices too ... sometimes, I can hold it on both ends and wiggle and the banana slices will just fall out. For the stubborn ones, just a light tap slicer end(s) on a hard surface, and out they pop.The slicer is HUGE, by the way, and might work even on plantains(???).  On the small-average sized banana, it takes a little maneuvering to place the huge cutter, and some slices will come out quite angled while the others will be uniformly rounded.  No matter, a slice is a slice, is a slice.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9EMJLB2Q0MWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9EMJLB2Q0MWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">After having wasted millions on inferior banana slicers, I realized that the average over-the-counter slicers are useless on most of the 739 cultivated varieties of the cylindrical yellow fruit.  That's why I'm delighted to endorse the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!  I've yet to find a type it couldn't slice with ease.  The Hutzler performed beautifully on the fruit I bought in Cuba (the Havana banana), the banana from Georgia (the Savannah banana), and the sucker I bought in Missoula from a washed-up teen idol (the Hanna Montana banana).  It provided uniform slices when used on the petrified specimen from Ricky Ricardo's old nightclub (the Tropicana banana), as well as fruit grown in the flood plain of the serpentine Pennsylvania river (the Susquehanna banana).  Say goodbye to blisters caused by slicing fruit now that the Hutzler 571 is available from Amazon (with a doctor's prescription).  All I can say is, this is a great time to be alive and be slicing bananas!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RISUUH3GSFGPP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RISUUH3GSFGPP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Cuba:LOCATION, 	-Havana:LOCATION, 	-Georgia:LOCATION, 	-Missoula:LOCATION, 	-Hanna:LOCATION, 	-Montana:LOCATION, 	-Ricky:PERSON, 	-Ricardo:PERSON, 	-Tropicana:LOCATION, 	-Pennsylvania:LOCATION, 	-Susquehanna:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">When I was a child we did not have this magical banana slicer technology, because we were poor and deprived and were forced to use these contraptions called knives which were really just small death traps. Nobody knows the pain and suffering I have had to indure during these banana slicing quests. I have lost three fingers, a toe, an eye, and a little brother all because this amazing 571 Banana Slicer didn't exist back then! I was hospitalized for suicide, but really I wasn't trying to kill myself I just wanted to eat this delicious fruit in slices.  Trust me buy this product it will not only save you money, but also your limbs, family, and years and years of therapy!  Due to my missing eye and fingers this review took me six days to complete.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">It's a good sturdy product that does a fine job cutting bananas.  However, I am not sure if buying this was such a good idea considering how it's affected my quality of life.  My banana consumption has gone up a somewhat implausible 3200%.  I'm averaging 30-34 bananas a day and if things don't change I know I am not going to be around for much longer.  Every day starts out the same, get the bananas, slice the bananas, eat the bananas, and then do it again, and again...it never stops.  I lost my job last month and my wife and kids have all disowned me.  Sadly, I'm okay with this as long as I get my next banana fix.  You know, it would be kind of cool if they offered the slicer in different colors too.  This way I could coordinate it with the decor of my kitchen.  Dear god, someone make this nightmare end; someone help me stop loving neatly cut, uniformly shaped, slices of banana.  Expertly cut with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, the best and worst kitchen utensil to have ever been created.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVR6BA79L72TV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVR6BA79L72TV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Before I begin, let me say that the 571B has become my daily point-and-slice tool. It is now a firm addition to my pocket inventory.The 571 is basically a rebadge of the classic 491. This is the long awaited B version which adds waterproofing, a 12% more lightweight chassis, sloping stalk ends, and various pro-sumer targeted features. Short of heavy duty models with adjustable spines, this is the most consistent 18er you will find at this size. Period. It scored an 87.6125 slice rate in laboratory testing.My only niggle is that I miss the 'elasti-loc' groove that was found in the late 4 series models. In trouserless situations where utility belts are impractical or frowned upon (IE: in my local indoor swimming pool), I found that with the 571B tucked into my speedos, it did not hold firmly to my hip and I was often having to adjust it back to my side. One time I nearly missed an impromptu BS opportunity when the 571B wasn't in immediate reach. What a panic! Luckily I was directed to its location by the helpful pointing from my fellow pool patrons but this may not always be the case. Yes, it is compatible with the swimwear-attachment housing (v141) to combat this problem but I found that to be cumbersome and detracted from the freestyle nature of this product.It is compatible with the redesigned lanyards, but after the controversy surrounding 'nipplegate', I'm still not comfortable using them.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4SUWX46J6SQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4SUWX46J6SQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">Don't take it on the airplane.  As an airline pilot, I got tired of slicing my bananas that come in the crew meals with the crash axe, so one day, as we were cruising at FL350, I came across this on the internet.  It took me a while to order it, because ATC kept bugging us about traffic, and holding patterns or something like that, I wasn't paying attention....but anyway, I ordered it just before touching down, and when I got home from the trip, it was waiting for me at the front door!  I could hardly contain my excitement.  So much was my enthusiasm, that I called crew scheduling and asked to be put on a trip so I could try it out.  They were happy to oblige, and gave me the red eye to Newark...Anyway, banana slicer in hand, I happily made my way to the airport, and towards security.  Well, apparently TSA didn't think much of the banana slicer, and took it away. :(  So I am back to slicing my banana with the crash axe...and I hate Newark.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAZDGUHTR87X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAZDGUHTR87X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-ATC:ORGANIZATION, 	-Newark:LOCATION, 	-TSA:ORGANIZATION, 	-Newark:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

But when you've sliced as many as i have you'd get soft too.  Fat chance I was retiring now. Not with a '57 convertible half way paid off and a tab at the banana stand on 4th that was well past its shelf life. I was a one punch palooka half way to loserville, smelling like cheap cologne and broken dreams.But then she walked in.  She was a knock out.  the kind of girl that made old men suck in their gut and young men puff out their chest.  "We'll hello there sweetheart, the dentist office is next door", I said with a smile."I'm not looking for the dentist", she said.  "I'm looking for Johnny Flynn Private Slicer.""We'll you came to the right place", I said, mustering up what I hoped was a look of confidence.  "Tell me what's on your mind."The story she told would have turned the most jaded slicer green with banana envy.  It was a big job.  The biggest. And even though my gut was turning somersaults I knew I couldn't turn it down.  This was the kind of slicing gig that would make a hundred reputations or destroy a thousand more.Her father was the head of the Dole banana conglomerate and some Ivy League poindexter came up with the big idea to do the annual customer gala with a casino night theme.  But this time they were gunna use banana chips instead of poker chips.  These babies had to be stripped, sliced and dried to exact measurements if they were going to be handled by Dole's biggest clients."I heard you're the best", she said."Was the best", I thought.  "Yeah, I've still got the chops. Watch this. I grabbed my number 7 knife and threw a banana in the air. I swung at it and missed it entirely.  My knife stabbed down through nothin' but air and dropped out of my hand on the table in front of me.  I watched the banana spin slowly as it fell fell fell and slap, like some miracle you read about in those dime store slicer mags, the banana landed on the knife blade and was cut cleanly in two.  My jaw dropped open in amazement and my eyes were big as saucers."Impressive", she said."Impossible", I thought.  "Yep, impressive is my middle name.", I stammered.She tossed her red hair back and said, "You got the job. See you Saturday at eight.""B... Buh... but, we haven't talked about my fee.She laughed and said as she walked to the door, "Whatever your usual fee is, I'll pay triple."Then she added, "Oh, and if you blow this gig you'll never work in this town again."And with a slam of the door she was gone.  I realized then she hadn't told me her name. That didn't matter.  Everyone knew who she was. It was splashed across the society pages every week.  "Dole diva doles out dollars to the down and despondent" or "Lecherous love lorn Lothario leaves Linda Livingston livid".  L. & L. but friends just called her Elle."You'll never work in this town again".Those words echoed over and over in my head.  As I reached for my hat my hand was shaking.  But then, I looked down at the table and saw the miracle banana perfectly sliced.... an accident, or was it?  Maybe the big guy up stairs was gunna save my sorry heiner once again.  I said a quick thanks to my guardian slicer and headed home.  Once I got in bed doubt crashed into my head like a 500 lb gorilla on a sack of Dole's finest.  I wasn't gunna come out of this.  Not ol' Banana Fingers.  I needed help fast and I knew just where to get it.  Johnny Flynns mentor in this business was a crusty old slicer named Harvey Muldoon.  Long retired he learned the trade over seas cooking banana fritters and stew for the yanks during WWI.  If anyone could help me pull this off it was him.  I know it was late but I went over and told him everything--about the dame, the gig and the banana trick.  He sat their stone faced until I told him about the banana flip, miss and slice.  If it wasn't so late in the evening I would swear he shed a tiny tear.  He got up from his chair and stood there. And with a smile he said, "I guess you're going to be needing this."  He dragged the paint chipped chair over to the corner of the room, got up on it.  Reaching up to the ceiling he pushed at a plank which moved out of the way.  He reached into the ceiling compartment and pulled out a box wrapped in an old World War I army issue banana sack.  Inside was a battered tin box.  With a look of immense pride he handed it to me like a father handing someone their new born to hold for the first time.  "This saved my life", he said as he carefully lifted the dented metal lid.  Inside was a hand cut form made of velvet and soft cotton and nestled in the middle was a strange looking device. Reverently he took it out and handed it to me.  "Be careful now.  It's razor sharp.""What is it" I said.It's the Hutzler 571.  It's what gave me the speed and precision to feed thousands of doughboys a day with mess tins and steaming bowls of banana fritters, pudding and stew.I was intrigued but skeptical... until I saw it in action.  Shazam! It sliced bananas faster than Ricky Ricardo could smack a conga drum."I will take good care of it", I said solemnly."You better. It's yours now.", he said.I was overwhelmed. "I don't know what to say.""You can start with a simple thank you" he said with a smirk.Come Saturday I was all ready.  I made a small leather holster for it so that I could pull it out at a moments notice.  I practiced my draw in front of the mirror day and night.  I can't say that the event went perfectly.  But I got the satisfaction of Elle saying I could slice her bananas any old time of the year.I found my confidence that day.  Thanks to some divine help and an old man's secret weapon I made it to the big banana leagues.  No more scraping around for the odd job. Now I named my fee and sliced my way across the banana circuit.  But still, with my fame and banana jet set status Linda Livingston was still out of my league.  Now when I read about her in the society section I save the article and place them in a folder in the large steel safe along with a battered tin box. When I see it I say a quick thanks to her for walking into my life and giving this old flatfoot a chance to start again.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CNMGRXMIVWZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CNMGRXMIVWZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Johnny:PERSON, 	-Flynn:PERSON, 	-Ivy:ORGANIZATION, 	-League:ORGANIZATION, 	-Dole:PERSON, 	-Dole:PERSON, 	-Linda:PERSON, 	-Livingston:PERSON, 	-Elle:PERSON, 	-Dole:PERSON, 	-Johnny:PERSON, 	-Flynns:PERSON, 	-Harvey:PERSON, 	-Muldoon:PERSON, 	-Ricky:PERSON, 	-Ricardo:PERSON, 	-Elle:PERSON, 	-Linda:PERSON, 	-Livingston:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">My mother taught me how to cook.  She was really quite good at it.  Standing at her side over the course of years, I learned how to make everything imaginable: homemade pastas, bisques, pies, pizzas, breads, stews, you name it.  I have a distinct memory of being in the grocery store with her when I was about ten years old.  With my little hand resting in hers, I gazed at the produce while she filled our cart with fresh ingredients for the evening's meal.  My eyes rested on an odd piece of fruit (I think?) that may well have been the only thing in that produce section that we had never brought home to our kitchen before."Ba...banana...?"  I read from the sign in a haze of confusion.  The instant the words left my lips, I felt my mother's hand release me and pull away as if I had just burst into flames.Her eyes narrowed and became cold and terrified. "What did you just say??" she said with a crack in her voice.I repeated the dirty word.  She turned white and told me to never say it again.  My heart was pounding.  I knew that I would never say it to her again.The next several weeks were awkward.  Clearly I wanted to know the story behind those hideous and terrifying fruits, but judging by what happened in the store, it would probably kill my mother if I brought it up again.  We worked silently in the kitchen.Finally, things thawed out.  We started having fun again, talking and joking around like we used to.  That is, until the day that mother keeled over while pulling a roast out of the oven.  It was all such a blur: my screaming and crying while daddy frantically called the ambulance, the medics pulling the roast off of mother and whisking her away on a stretcher.  The next thing I knew, I was holding her hand again, this time while she lay in a hospital bed.Hooked up to so many machines, barely able to speak, she mostly just gazed at me with her kind eyes.  The doctors told us that she had a heart attack and just needed some rest."Mary," she said.  "Yes mother," I responded.  "I think I owe you an explanation..."She went on to tell me that in all of her years of mastering the culinary skills, there was only one food that she couldn't conquer: the banana.  She told me that she once spent an entire week trying to make a banana creme pie, but could never figure out how to slice the banana in perfect uniform slices."I wasted so much food, angrily throwing each attempt in the trash.  Your father got so mad at me for spending his paychecks so foolishly that he almost left me.  At the end of the week, I..." she choked on the words.  "I almost killed myself."The machines in the room started making all sorts of scary sounds.  Her color changed so drastically in an instant.  Doctors and nurses rushed in.  Her grip on my hand only got stronger."Mary!  Please!  You have to figure out the banana.  Do it for me!  For me!"  And with that, she released my hand.  She was gone.After years of therapy, I finally started cooking again when I got married.  My husband was delighted upon discovering the talent that I had kept so secret.  Thankfully, bananas never came up.One evening, we invited my husband's boss over for dinner.  I planned a brilliant menu and everything came out perfect.  At the end of the meal, my husband beamed at me.  "Thank you" his eyes seemed to say.  His boss eyed us approvingly.I brought out dessert: an exotic fruits salad with almond shortbread cookies.  The men clapped and cheered and we all ate hungrily, even though we were already full.  I felt alive for the first time in years."Well Mary, you've really outdone yourself!" my husband's boss chirped cheerfully.  "One thing, though...How can you make a fruit salad without bananas?  My mom ALWAYS put bananas in our fruit salad."My heart sank.  I felt like throwing up everything I had just eaten.  The silence in the room seemed to last an eternity and turned into a painful ringing in my ears.  My face burned and I could see that my husband was blushing furiously, too.  I knew that the evening was over. After some very awkward chit chat and some obvious excuses, our guest of honor was heading for the door.  The next day, my husband was fired.Night after night I could feel my mother's piercing stare, and whenever I managed to fall asleep it was only to hear her last words repeat over and over:  Figure out the banana!  Do it for me!  For me!  For me!  For me!"After a couple of weeks, I thought I was really going to lose my mind.  I was totally alone in the world, as my husband had turned to alcohol and refused to talk to me.  I finally decided to get online and reach out.  Surely someone else had had a problem like mine?After a series of failed google searches (dead mother haunting me about bananas, husband fired because of no bananas in fruit salad, bananas *comma* suicide) I managed to enter something that yielded an amazing result.  I managed to stumble upon the amazon page for the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  I savored every customer review while hopeful tears streamed my face.  It seemed to good to be true.  With shaking hands, I placed my order.The next step was far more terrifying.  I went to the grocery store and bought a bunch of bananas.  Their flesh felt so scary against my skin.  Was I really doing it?  I felt ashamed as I handed over a hundred dollar bill and ran out clutching the bananas, too scared to wait for my change.Finally, it arrived.  Nothing broke my focus as I carefully unpeeled a banana and placed the device over the fruit.  I held my breath and closed me eyes, pressing down.  When I opened my eyes I couldn't believe them.  The enigma that lay before me moments before was now a perfect pile of banana "coins".  Peace, at last.I baked the most beautiful banana creme pie that day and delivered it to my husbands old boss.  Within the week he got his old job back.  We owe everything to this amazing product.  Thanks Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MNS3EGP6BC90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MNS3EGP6BC90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Mary:PERSON, 	-Mary:PERSON, 	-Mary:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">Normally, using a knife, on an average day I can slice 1-2 thousand bananas.  Using the Hutzler 571, I can double that amount.  On my best day using the Hutzler, I sliced 5 thousand bananas.  These numbers speak for themselves.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P1XFR6NQ553R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3P1XFR6NQ553R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer gave me the confidence to finally eat a banana in public.

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I was happy to see that Hutzler has finally made an entry-level banana slicer.  I just bought this for my grandmother who doesn't need the extra features.I have a Hutzler 590i banana slicer that I have been using for almost two years.  It slices bananas so easily and it keeps me in touch with my social circle as well.  The 590i has bluetooth and an app for iPhone and Android.  It notifies my Facebook when I slice my bananas, and tells my friends how many bananas we are eating, and how many slices we get per banana.  This is very useful to make sure I eat more bananas than any of my friends.  It also has a plug-in that posts the pics of the sliced bananas to Instagram.I can't imagine using any other banana slicer.  But my grandmother, who has just started using Facebook, doesn't need these extra features.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21DI2DUT7SSV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21DI2DUT7SSV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Facebook:ORGANIZATION, 	-Facebook:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">What have we come to as a society where the most precious moments now fall prey to automation? I can recall as a boy growing in the Ozarks waking each cold morning to go  pick bananas from the local 7-11 with my Grandpa.  We would bring them home in a wicker basket.  He  lectured me like Polonius  on women, intimacy, bananas (occasionally interweaving all lessons at once).  We would arrive home to spend hours by the wood burning stove fighting off the winter's chill slicing bananas so uniform you could measure the snowfall in bananas - each hand made slice measuring precisely an inch.  Well thanks Hutzler. This is all gone now and my Grandpa has only his avocado scoop to live for. Another  "slice" of the American experience has become rotten from thoughtless technology.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33O2ANPJLOVTN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33O2ANPJLOVTN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Personally, I find the description of the product Highly inaccurate!!**"Faster, safer than using a knife."  Really, I tried to use this to spread peanut butter, and it was NOT faster.**"Great for cereal."  Not so much, I have never had so much trouble slicing cereal in all my life.**"Plastic, dishwasher safe."  Common, Hutzler, who owns a "plastic dishwasher."**"Slice your banana with one quick motion."  Yea, right.  It took me at least two motions to peel the darn thing!!**"Kids love slicing their own bananas."

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I purchased this banana slicer with innocent intentions. I simply wanted an easier way to slice bananas for my kids in the morning. I was sick and tired of the horrific hours spent painstakIngly slicing bananas one coin at a time.When I saw this banana slicer on Amazon, it was like the heavens above opened and angels began to sing. I had to have it.I ordered it and set up a tent next to my mailbox so it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. A tool this powerful has to be guarded at all times. 3 to 5 days later, it arrived.The anticipation was almost too much to handle as I ripped open the nondescript cardboard box. There it was, the tool that would change my life for the better.I nervously peeled the first banana of the morning, not knowing whether to be scared or exhilarated. I placed the banana cutter over the banana and started pressing down, gently at first, then harder and harder as my confidence improved in leaps and bounds. Just like that, I was through the banana. I let out a little gasp. It had felt so good!I quickly peeled another banana and sliced right through it. Then I sliced another . . . Then another. Soon all the bananas in the house were sliced, but I wasn't ready to stop. I had to slice more bananas. I went to the store, intent on buying a couple bananas to fuel my new addiction. When I saw all those bananas, I couldn't control myself. I started opening them and slIcing them right there in the store.Needless to say, I was asked to leave by a clerk who gave me a knowing look and muttered "banana slicer got another one" as he ushered me out the door. I rushed to the fruit stand and bought every banana they had. When my fiancé got home work, he found me frantically searching through a large pile of banana peels in hope is missed a banana.I gave this banana slicer 5 stars because it works as advertised. Actually, it works too well. I'm writing this review from the library in Ithica State Prison because I was caught in a neighbors house slicing bananas. Use it at your own risk.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U3A751M8SFN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U3A751M8SFN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Ithica:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer saved my life and my farm.  I have struggled for years trying to get the correct flake to banana ratio in my morning cereal but it was just getting more and more difficult.  It finally reached the point where I was loosing weight.  Trying to select the correct number of flakes, or even rice krispies, with inconsistent banana slices took so long my cereal would get mushy and who can eat that?  The heat of a Texas summer began to take its toll without the proper amount of potassium and my declining caloric intake.  One day I passed out while doing my morning chores.  The horses, dog, cats and chickens did not get fed.  They too started loosing weight.  The chickens became so weak they could not outrun the fox or coyotes.  A neighbor, noticing the flock of buzzards lining up at my gate reported me for animal cruelty.  When the cops showed up they found me wasting away under a tree.  One officer, being a kind, empathetic soul, slipped this banana slicer into my pocket - he understood my plight.  My world changed forever.  I could now eat my cereal lickety split.  I started regaining my strength and electrolyte balance.  I went to court and got my animals back.  The horses now frolic.  The cats are having litters with renewed vigor and the few hens that survived the fox and coyotes are hatching new chicks to replenish the flock.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O3VNIPX1N7HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O3VNIPX1N7HS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Texas:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I used to get so stressed wondering how the devil I'm supposed to slice my bananas. I would try biting a piece off then spitting it back out onto the counter. Then the 571B Banana slicer came into my life. I have never been happier. It's come to the point where I feel like I really no longer have any need for human contact. It's so useful around the house that I'm now petitioning the state of Illinois to allow me to legally wed my 571B banana slicer. I hope that one day soon, I will be able to show off my dazzling ring to people and tell people that I'm now Mrs. Slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X2KNQQXKT9Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X2KNQQXKT9Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Illinois:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Wow, what can I say? Amidst the turbulent times in which we live it is easy to become pessimistic. Every day our news feeds are filled with more horrific events leaving us wondering what could possibly happen next. It is a rare occasion that you find something which can help you rise above the chaos and see that there is goodness left in the world. This product is one of those things. My faith in humanity is restored. It is so very refreshing to see that there are still those who see a desperate need in our global community and rise to the challenge of fulfilling it. Never again will humanity struggle with the hapless and near impossible task of slicing bananas with a knife. We have truly reached the age of enlightenment.As a sociologist I am often asked what innovation I predict as defining the 21st century, smart-phones, social media, the Kardashians? I can now say with total conviction that our century will be known by posterity as the dawn of the Hutzler 571 Banana slicer.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23BWA95TBLW74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23BWA95TBLW74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Kardashians:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Oh my! What a life saver this little gem is! For most of my life I have been using a potato gun to launch my bananas through the large harp I keep in my kitchen but the results are mediocre at best. They never end up being sliced at the right angle, or they bounce off the wall onto the floor and not into the cereal bowl. But now I don't have to keep all this heavy equipment around and no more cleaning up a huge mess! What a great product! I can't thank the good folks that invented this enough. I owe you my life. Seriously. I would take a bullet for you people. I am currently in a car outside "protecting" your house from intruders. You are welcome. This is gratitude, not stalking.

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">I speak for everyone that peeling a banana is one of the hardest things to do and solve; I even call it nature's Rubik's cube. Not every banana is the same so I always have to try peeling it in different ways: top-down, bottom-up, vertically, horizontally, perpendicularly, sexually, every geometrical term out there, you name it, I've tried it all. Worse, some bananas are small or too ripe so its various complex shapes would often result in me destroying the banana. Even my girlfriend, who seems to have a good grip on big, large, and thick bananas, seem to be at a loss when she needs to handle smaller and mushier ones. But this crafty little device just improved our work-life balance by 33.33 percent (repeating of course) as I can now eat on my way to work without being late because I had to eat my breakfast. Total lifesaver.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I6C00FHCQBHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I6C00FHCQBHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I'm sticking with the method I've used for decades, I hold the banana up to my ceiling fan and then I run around the living room and catch the slices in my cereal bowl.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">At first, I was very pleased with the performance of this slicer. When it works, it works well. But then my daughter tried to use it, and was unable. Apparently it's a right-handed slicer, a fact that they neglected to mention on the packaging. I'm a little irritated that they do not even offer for sale a left-handed model. This makes it very difficult to involve my daughter in the food preparation process to help her develop the skills she will need for marriage one day. It also means more work for me, as I can't share the work of banana slicing.On the plus side, I will say that this slicer has 'cut' my food prep time considerably, even if I can't share the work. It is a very well-made product, aside from the hand bias. I hope they will come out with a left-handed version soon. I would buy it.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UI76Z4P4ZY7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UI76Z4P4ZY7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I am a man on the go. I will just say I spend my nights on top of buildings prowling the streets of my crime ridden home town. I sometimes get in scuffles with psychopaths and need a pick me up afterward. Bananas have always been my number one fruit. They supply the appropriate amount of potassium I need to defeat evil-doers. I stay light weight on my stake outs and don't have a pocket to stick my beloved bananas in. So, I have gone with out for years. I have never been truly happy. Until...the Victorio Kitchen 571B Banana Slicer was released! I had my butler purchase one for me and I can't remember a time when I was more happy. Each slice fits perfectly into my utility belt. So whenever I'm hanging above a vat of acid thinking of an escape plan or growling at a middle man to give me the name of his boss, I can enjoy a quick bite of banana bliss. So to any chaos causing clowns, fear flinging fiends or Bane, beware the Bat is now powered with the proper amount if vitamins needed to take you down. Thank you Victorio, you are not the banana slicer I deserved, but the banana slicer I needed.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V03QLP0ZR4OB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V03QLP0ZR4OB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Victorio:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">At first glance it would seem that the learning curve of this product would be moderately difficult at worst - however, be ready for the orientation period. I found it challenging but rewarding once bananas began to fall out like gold coins at a pirate's wedding.However, I found their was no product support 800-line what so ever. Amazing?!?  Also the written instructions are ambiguous, misleading, and quite mischievous.  I pray they narrow the gap and expand on their arrogant one line instruction, "Line up banana with slicer and push down." Fix this and you have a 5 star product.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJSYFNO4XXATY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJSYFNO4XXATY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkGreen;">As an owner of the Hutzler 569, 570 and 571 I'm here to tell you that this banana slicer is far superior to the other models. The 569 would leave stringy banana "veins" all over the bars. The 570 would cause the banana slices to turn brown and the kids would scream and cry when I tried to get them to eat them. The 571's Siri feature is very helpful when needing information on the history of the banana and import/export laws. The 571 also takes panoramic photos of the banana prior to slicing. I'm so glad I stood in line to upgrade. The 571 is everything they said it would be and more. It doesn't run Google Maps yet, but they're working on that.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27AAL2D885F8J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27AAL2D885F8J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Siri:PERSON, 	-Google:ORGANIZATION, 	-Maps:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I wish I had known about the 571 before I invested in the diamond-tipped industrial bandsaw I purchased weeks ago for my banana slicing workshop. The Hutzler 571 slices bananas so efficiently, I had to lay off twelve of my banana slicing specialists because we were just getting a surplus of banana slices in a fraction of the time. It really helps my bottom line, but it may be hurting the banana slicing industry.One question I would ask: is there an attachment that can make the slices in shapes other than circular? I hope I don't seem ungrateful... now that handcrafted banana slices are so easy to make, maybe I'm taking it for granted, but perhaps it's time for triangular or rhomboid slices. Here's hoping that multiple-shape functionality will be added to the Hutzler 572.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C2G0UTXALY0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C2G0UTXALY0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">The product description says this item is "great for cereal." Nay, nay, I say.

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I just hanged up with Stacey the customer service rep for  Hustler 69 Banana Inc. the parent company of Hutzler 571 Banana Inc the manufacturers of this item. I am flabbergasted by the answer I got. Whilst shopping for life essentials I found this and it was a real blessing. Since I was a 8 year old in Morocco I had two dreams, a banana slicer and a banana straightener. Unfortunately the latter has still not yet been invented. But, lets go to the point of my situation. The banana slicer clearly depicts a Pale Banana PANTONE 12-0824 TPX color, the one I received is a Banana Crepe PANTONE 13-0815 and it is simply unacceptable. No refunds, no explanation, Stacey passed my call to "Rori" (what in the name of bananas is that name?) and he still did not solve issue nor was able to explain why we have this banana tone divergence. Word of caution for you shopper: Pale Banana will not solve your issues. Shipped it back even without a refund.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24UQ2BU6KJMDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24UQ2BU6KJMDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Stacey:PERSON, 	-Hustler:ORGANIZATION, 	-Banana:ORGANIZATION, 	-Inc.:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Banana:ORGANIZATION, 	-Inc:ORGANIZATION, 	-Morocco:LOCATION, 	-Stacey:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">When I was a child we did not have this magical banana slicer technology, because we were poor and deprived and were forced to use these contraptions called knives which were really just small death traps. Nobody knows the pain and suffering I have had to indure during these banana slicing quests. I have lost three fingers, a toe, an eye, and a little brother all because this amazing 571 Banana Slicer didn't exist back then! I was hospitalized for suicide, but really I wasn't trying to kill myself I just wanted to eat this delicious fruit in slices.  Trust me buy this product it will not only save you money, but also your limbs, family, and years and years of therapy!  Due to my missing eye and fingers this review took me six days to complete.  Don't make the same mistake as I did and resort to using knives. Now that I have this 571 banana slicer my life is back on the right track, and I can finally sleep at night!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLFQFIXIXBSP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLFQFIXIXBSP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkGreen;">Hutzler Devices Corp., an almost 90-year-old, Iowa-based manufacturer of exquisite products for the home (e.g., the EZ-Electric Dog Polisher, the Hydraulic Suppository Insert-o-tron, etc.), has created its first kitchen product! The Hutzler Banana Slicer (HBL) is a dream come true. (Hutzler, why did you wait so long?)This beautiful product--it's yellow, just like bananas!--slices an entire banana in a single stroke. If you were to slice the banana with a knife, it would probably take you an extra 10 seconds to do it. Also, let's say you want to slice only half of the banana. You can cut it in half with the knife and then slice one half with the HBS. And the next day you'll have the other half to eat! (Just be sure to put the second half into the refrigerator right after you slice the first half because the second half will be too squishy-gooey for the next day. Who likes to eat squishy-gooey banana halves or slices? I sure don't.)I'm giving the HBS only 4 stars, though, because of what is a major drawback--for me at least:  I like my banana slices to be about 1/5th inch wide. The HBS slices your banana into pieces that are 1/4th inch wide. The 1/5th inch width slices look much nicer on top of a bowl of granola. Perhaps more important is the fact that eating 1/5th inch slices is easier on your digestive system, not to mention how gobbling down 1/4th inch slices makes you look like a starving pig. Think about it. You know I'm speaking the truth.Bottom line?  Well, do NOT let the slice width keep you from using the Hutzler Banana Slicer. If you don't buy one, you won't possess what surely must be the finest banana slicer on the market. Heck, it might even be the only banana slicer on the market. I guess the only way I could find out is to google "banana slicer" on Google.com. You can find info on just about everything on Google--even maps! I love the internet.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KDEKH72456TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KDEKH72456TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:ORGANIZATION, 	-Devices:ORGANIZATION, 	-Corp.:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-HBS:ORGANIZATION, 	-HBS:ORGANIZATION, 	-Google:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">When I was a child I was stabbed in the face by a man in a Banana Costume.It was not Halloween.As a result of this cruel attack I have had to make do with my jaw permanently wired shut allowing only a half-inch of space between my teeth to consume all my favorite foods. As if that weren't bad enough, I have to live my fragile life with a crippling fear of Knives.. And Bananas.I have a reoccurring dream in which I am sitting at a marble dining room table with a black plate in front of me upon which sits one whole peeled Banana.I am hungry and I am not afraid. I want so badly to eat this Banana & digest all my fears but how will I ever get this weird smelling fleshy fruit of unknown texture into my tiny mouth crevasse?How can I move past my fears?The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.When I first came upon this product I was scared. I knew that color and shape. My mind reeled as I flashed back to that pasty white face and those drug-addled eyes contained within the violent Banana. So much pain.In the midst of this pain filled bitter memory I had a revelation. This was a tool of Banana Destruction!I ordered it immediately. I had it delivered overnight express. Because I am an Amazon Club member it was such a great deal!I instructed my mother to have a fully peeled Banana placed onto a plate on the marble dining room table that inhabits the "for guests only" Dining Room.Then I informed her that I would be staying in my room until the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer arrived.It was 1:37 pm when the doorbell rang. My mother, per my instructions, set the box next to the plate on the table and left the house. I recalled our argument the night before with sadness as I heard the front door close behind her, "I don't care where you go Mom but you can't stay here, it won't be safe!" A hard truth that I was eventually able to convince her of and now I was alone. The time had come.I recoiled as I smelled the violent fruit upon stepping into the hallway but this was no time for fear. This was my time. I walked down the long hallway leading toThe dining room table and sat down in front of the demon fruit. I then picked up the Amazon box and tore the taped area open with one fluid motion of unfathomable purpose. I saw struggling yellow rays of light trying to pour out from beneath the bubble wrap, so I unleashed them. And there it was. I wasted no time.I pulled the banana shaped banana slicer out of the box like a sword from stone and held it directly above my mushy fibrous victim. Then, with all the might my tiny-wired shut mouth could muster I yelled "GERDBYE BHERNANER!" as I slammed the slicer down into my enemy's flesh. I have to say the Hutzler 571 performed brilliantly. The slicer was the exact same shape of the banana, how did they know? I immediately grabbed a slice of the seething 'Nana and with great hopes held it up to my crippled orifice. It was a perfect fit. I slid my perfectly sliced enemy between my teeth onto my tongue and tasted the victory. It was sweet. So so sweet.I swallowed my fears one slice at a time and when the beast was gone, I was a new man.I owe my life to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. Thank you, Thank you...Thank you.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29CM6S96RG40S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29CM6S96RG40S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Club:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Nana:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">OK, right to the point. I figured if the Hutzler could provide perfect banana servings in seconds, how would it work for other foods that need sliced when served? Well, for me, meatloaf has always been a challenge, as someone always gets the primo, super-wide slice and someone ends up with a thinner than average cut. Problem solved?Not so fast.So I realized I needed to reduce the overall cross section of the loaf. OK, fine. I simply mashed and squished my meatloaf into a thinner, more-banana like tube. After I baked our dinner, I was all ready to slice up some perfectly proportioned servings for the family. Upon pulling out my perfectly-browned confection, I located it upon a cutting board.What I saw horrified me. My creation, shaped solely due to my unbridled desire to multi-task my 571B, in all its moistened browness, had transformed in appearance. Maybe, like me, you had never thought what a banana-sized, cooked meatloaf would look like.Well, I am here to warn you: Meatloaf should never look the same before you eat it as it will when your body is done digesting it. I never got to the slicing part as my appetite vanished.In summary, the Hutzler 571 is perfect for bananas, but not so awesome for cooked, banana-sized meatloaf. 3 stars.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZVNOT7GZQ35A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZVNOT7GZQ35A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I thought this thing would have been smaller.The blades are flush with the sides, so this product does NOT work if you are using it on a slightly curved surface such as a dinner plate. If you do get it cut on a flat surface, the banana pieces stick to the cutter itself, so you need s knife or fork just to separate the pieces!Also, it's very difficult to clean. You have to get in between each blade to get the banana pieces out.I used it once, gave it to my coworker, and never looked back.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R760MPUTLN5KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R760MPUTLN5KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">As far as banana slicers go, this has to be the best banana slicer I have ever used. The nice even slices make my cereal even more fun to eat. No more worries about getting too much banana in one bite, and not enough in the other. Clean up is a breeze too.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NHJ03BVK9PY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NHJ03BVK9PY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Works wonderfully!  We used this to prepare banana slices for the dehydrator and it cut our time at least in half.  Pay attention to the fact that one side is like plastic blades and the other side is wide and flat.  If you use the wide and flat side, you will end up with banana mess.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A3UC1W78F5M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3A3UC1W78F5M0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">As a Mom to 2 kids and a demanding husband I knew I had to have this product. Anything that would save me a few extra minutes preparing endless meals would help me hold onto my sanity for just a little longer.  What I didn't count on was how impossible it became to prepare anything else which required individual slicing and cutting one piece at a time.  Suddenly cutting cheese, various fruits and vegetables became so taxing I found myself in tears and desperate for an answer.  I finally caved and started substituting bananas for everything else.  While the solution seemed to fix all my issues the rest of my family did not cope so well.  Instead of appreciating the quickness in which I prepared my daughters grilled banana sandwich I found her heaving in the garbage can.  My husband tells me his employees have lost all respect for him after watching him try to eat ham and banana sandwiches without retching.  And my son, who used to be my "good eater" is wasting away.  I've tried substituting boiled bananas for carrots, which while have always been a favorite of his, are the most time consuming and aggravating vegetables to cut.  But again he expresses his "gratitude" much the same way as my daughter, by retching in the nearest receptacle.  Now I find myself being investigated by child welfare for neglect, and they are running a battery of tests on my family members citing "dangerously high levels of potassium" and "lacking in any other necessary nutrients".  This product, which initially improved my life, has torn my family apart.  I should add however, I don't blame the product I blame my family.  They are bunch of ingrates with weak stomachs.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMXHQJ3E6VPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMXHQJ3E6VPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">The Hutzler has once again paved the way for modern innovation. Apple's recent announcement of the iPhone 7 is simply a poor hack of Hutzler's unsung heroic team of engineers.iPhone 7 is waterproof? Hutzler did it first.iPhone 7 missing the earphone jack? Hutzler was born without an earphone jack!iPhone 7 has greater battery life? I've NEVER charged my Hutzler since opening the box.iPhone 7 memory upgrades?

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">Wow, this thing is totally amazing!

<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I received Hutzler 571 banana slicer in a timely fashion and was pleasantly surprised at just how amazing it is...once I figured out how to use it. Word of warning: this comes with NO instructions!Before purchasing the Hutzler 571, it took an agonizing 15 seconds to cut a banana by hand, but now it only takes a mere 2 seconds!! I now have an extra 13 seconds of "me" time on banana days!!!! That extra 13 seconds has all but restored my sanity... so, I guess you could say that the Hutzler 571 banana slicer keeps me from going crazy ...so..it has SAVED MY LIFE!THANK YOU HUTZLER 571!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S21I2V7KXI3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S21I2V7KXI3Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Alas for me!  While I imagine this slicer is excellent at slicing the actual fruit of the banana, I have been completely unable to use it, because it does not come with a (necessary, in my opinion) peeler attachment.  Unless you have some other way to peel your banana at home (a professional-grade diesel-powered European fruit peeling machine, for example), you will be completely unable to use this device!  Hopefully Hutzler will introduce a 671 model soon with this vital upgrade!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EXYWVXI8V06H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EXYWVXI8V06H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">Finally, no more having to eat bananas in one bite! For years I have been telling people I don't like bananas because it hurts the back of my throat when I eat them! They are just too long! Thanks to the geniuses at Hutzler, they have provided us with an apparatus to SLICE the bananas into smaller pieces making them easier to chew! No more visits to the doctor for blistered tonsils and no more vomit on the floor from poking my uvula trying to eat this pesky fruit! Hutzler has stepped in where evolution could not and has allowed us to be able to enjoy the banana pain-free.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPCE2H69JIRVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPCE2H69JIRVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">This is truly a great product, no question. I used to make 2-3 trips a month to the ER due to banana-slicing injuries, so this has been a Godsend. However, if you're thinking of buying one, you have to be aware of something very important...The Hutzler 571 is designed for use by AT&T Wireless and Metro PC customers. It is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. You can try using it with Verizon Wireless, but not all of the features will be available. Unfortunately, the only VW-compatible product, the Apple iSlice, is not at all designed for bananas. For $29.00 you can buy a conversion kit, but that's a crude way to go.There are rumors that the HZ571 can be hacked, but I've had loads of experience with this and can't figure a way to hack this one. I've also heard Hutzler is working on a Verizon Wireless compatible model, but that's completely unconfirmed. A YouTube video of a Verizon version appears to be faked.If you really need a good banana slicer but have Verizon Wireless, you should go ahead and buy. Just be warned that it may not live up to expectations.Full disclosure: I do not own stock in Verizon, AT&T, Amazon, or Hutzler.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10FCV4GUUXWR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10FCV4GUUXWR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-AT&T:ORGANIZATION, 	-Wireless:ORGANIZATION, 	-Metro:ORGANIZATION, 	-VERIZON:ORGANIZATION, 	-Verizon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Wireless:ORGANIZATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Verizon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Wireless:ORGANIZATION, 	-Verizon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Verizon:ORGANIZATION, 	-Wireless:ORGANIZATION, 	-Verizon:ORGANIZATION, 	-AT&T:ORGANIZATION, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">It was a dark and stormy night, the lights kept blinking off and on with each bolt of lightning. The house was moaning and groaning with every ghostly gust of wind, the rain sounding like bullets hitting the windows.  I was frozen in place with fear worried that I would not be able to see the banana that I was about to slice.  Goodness knows I had hard enough time trying to get the milk into my bowl of cereal, the only thing that helped me was the familiar sound of the snap, crackle, and pop.  I was a little more than scared I would either not be able to find the kinfe to slice it with, or even worse that once found, I would drop that ever so sharp object on the cat and put a deep gash into her lovely fur and skin.All of a sudden I reached into the drawer, and there it was, my beautiful and ever so helpful Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  What a stroke of good fortune.  I could feel my fear being replaced by the calm and clear feelings of sccurity, knowing that all will be well in the world.  I felt safe.  I could have my cereal with perfectly sliced bananas and finally completely forgot about the storm outside and the screams for help from my neighbors.  This banana slicer saved my life.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R245LTU7MEDJLX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R245LTU7MEDJLX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">When I asked my wife what she wanted for Christmas, she said, "It's 10 inches long, plastic and shaped like a banana." This was the Christmas request I had been waiting for! Unaware that Amazon even sold sex toys, I was not about to ask questions, forging ahead with my order, expedited delivery... Imagine then my confusion when it arrived in the mail and she took it right out of my hands and announced that she'd be keeping it in the kitchen! Crestfallen doesn't even cover it. It took a week to muster the courage but I managed to ask recently if I might be allowed to watch her play with it at some point and she said it's not a game but if I'm ever at home when she does, she'll try to remember to call me in. So we're not completely dead in the water. Overall this gift has been much more one-sided than I had hoped but she does seem to love it and in the mean time, I remain optimistic.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DOLBA5EB8GD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DOLBA5EB8GD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is a godsend!!  As a proud owner of model nos. 1-570, I NEEDED to see what the 571 was all about.  Standing in line overnight in the wind and weather at the Hutzler Banana Slicer flagship store in midtown to be one of first to get the 571 was well worth it--thunder snow be damned!  I wasn't disappointed when I got the 571 home.  It sliced bananas in exactly the same way the other 570 models before it, but it did it with a style, dare I say an "attitude," that was altogether different.  You'll marvel at the sleek styling, the sexy lines, and bend-me-over-and-call-me-rover daring do of this innovative, modem marvel.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROWMXEB3F6UMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROWMXEB3F6UMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Before I purchased the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer, I was struggling with depression. You name the pill, I was probably on it. I was basically walking around life high as a kite on anti-depressants. Life was hard.You see, as a young child my mother never taught me how to slice a banana. I had to just ... eat the banana AS IS. This was very difficult for me. All my friends were eating peanut butter and sliced banana sandwiches, having fruit salad with sliced banana, simply enjoying the fruits of the sliced banana. I was living ignorantly in a world where everyone sliced bananas. I was constantly teased about eating bananas whole. I often went home and cried myself to sleep over the scrutiny of everyone around me. As a result, I grew a fear of the banana. I was diagnosed as having Bananaphobia. This is a highly researched phobia, and is basically unable to be cured. I hid myself from the world most of my teenage life due to Bananaphobia. I felt ... undesirable and lost.This continued until about 2 weeks, 3 hours and 57 minutes ago, when I purchased the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer in attempt to feel better about myself. LET ME TELL YOU ...I am forever a changed woman. Now I hold my head high in confidence! I walk into a room and basically demand attention. I have never felt more beautiful in my life. I was changed that day ... and for the best I tell you, the BEST! Everyday I go to work, eating my sliced bananas, and I can tell people think I'm awesome. I see them out of the corner of my eyes ... just staring at me in pure envy, wishing they too, had a perfectly sliced banana. One man even thought I was so awesome, he proposed to me!! I don't know much about him ... but I knew he had good taste ... sooooo ... I married him! Together we eat sliced bananas, and dare people to taunt us. So, THANK YOU Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer .. THANK YOU for making my life complete and finding me true love!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28UVJ7VHSBBZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28UVJ7VHSBBZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Bananaphobia:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">For those of you like me who are getting ready for the Zombie Apocalypse, this is a MUST HAVE tool! I had already packed my survival bags when I came across this item and I just couldn't pass it up. When food supplies are low this 571B tool will help you divide bananas equally so no one feels like they are getting ripped off (which could lead to fights and cause noise that could attract zombies). THIS PRODUCT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE!The only downside that I've found (which on it's behalf is rather amazing) is I lost it yesterday and was searching my whole house trying to find it. I tore through the kitchen drawers and looked everywhere. Then sadly looking at the bananas I realized I'd never be able to slice again, I saw it. Snuggled warmly between two juicy bananas. Great camo 571B, great camo.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMJJUX3YJF2UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMJJUX3YJF2UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">As many of you know during World War 8 evil aliens dug up Hiter's corpse and resurrected him using the power of science.  SCIENCE!  The only way to stop the evil Hitler and the evil aliens was with the HOLY BANANA SLICER.  My comrades and I went on a quest to obtain the HOLY BANANA SLICER for SCIENCE!  Heroic soldiers heroically defended the earth heroically while my heroic comrades and I heroically fought off evil aliens heroically while heroically charging towards the center of the earth heroically while on our heroic quest to heroically obtain the heroic HOLY BANANA SLICER.  After obtaining the heroic HOLY BANANA SLICER we heroically charged down the rainbow bridge heroically while heroically shooting heroic laser beams out of our heroic HOLY BANANA SLICER heroically.  We then heroically slew the evil Hitler with our heroic weapon with our heroic comrades.  Our heroic accomplishments are heroically recorded into heroic history textbooks as many of you heroically know.So remember heroic kids if you want to be a heroic hero that heroically saves the world heroically YOU NEED TO BUY THE HOLY BANANA SLICER!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CPPSHZWOJXPH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CPPSHZWOJXPH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hitler:PERSON, 	-Hitler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">As a Mom to 2 kids and a demanding husband I knew I had to have this product. Anything that would save me a few extra minutes preparing endless meals would help me hold onto my sanity for just a little longer.  What I didn't count on was how impossible it became to prepare anything else which required individual slicing and cutting one piece at a time.  Suddenly cutting cheese, various fruits and vegetables became so taxing I found myself in tears and desperate for an answer.  I finally caved and started substituting bananas for everything else.  While the solution seemed to fix all my issues the rest of my family did not cope so well.  Instead of appreciating the quickness in which I prepared my daughters grilled banana sandwich I found her heaving in the garbage can.  My husband tells me his employees have lost all respect for him after watching him try to eat ham and banana sandwiches without retching.  And my son, who used to be my "good eater" is wasting away.  I've tried substituting boiled bananas for carrots, which while have always been a favorite of his, are the most time consuming and aggravating vegetables to cut.  But again he expresses his "gratitude" much the same way as my daughter, by retching in the nearest receptacle.  Now I find myself being investigated by child welfare for neglect, and they are running a battery of tests on my family members citing "dangerously high levels of potassium" and "lacking in any other necessary nutrients".  This product, which initially improved my life, has torn my family apart.  I should add however, I don't blame the product I blame my family.  They are bunch of ingrates with weak stomachs.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMXHQJ3E6VPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMXHQJ3E6VPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">Wow, this thing is totally amazing!

<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkRed;">It's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would peel a banana whole before eating it or retain the peel and peel the skin down gradually as you take a bite? Now, a clever man would peel a banana whole, because he would know that only a great fool would allow the peel to hang loosely over his hand. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose to retain the peel. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose to discard the banana peel.However, because the banana comes from Southeast Asia, as everyone knows, and Southeast Asia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose to retain the banana peel. But you must have suspected I would have known the banana's origin, so I can clearly not choose to discard the peel.You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have offered to take the banana peel, trusting in your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose to discard the peel. But you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man might one day invent an ingenious way of cutting a banana such as the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, so you would have put the banana peel as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose to retain the peel.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B8U1OUG819O7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B8U1OUG819O7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Southeast:LOCATION, 	-Asia:LOCATION, 	-Southeast:LOCATION, 	-Asia:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: DarkGreen;">Thank you Buddha for this amazing product. I only purchased it just for the very sole purpose of being able to write a review. Besides being the coolest white elephant gift giver, I also became quickly known to my townspeople as 'the Woman who slices perfect bananas.' Its a very well respected skill in my town.This product also has helped me eat more bananas, shop for bananas every 3 days to keep them in the perfect stages of ripeness and the shape for my tool which in turn gave me purpose in life. I also gained a few pounds with the extra sugar and it seemed to go to my booty , so this product is also a booty enhancer, wow, who knew?My experimentation in bananas has lead me to make banana fosters and that has brandy in it to flambé' so I also keep brandy in my house and that makes me warm and happy too. I like bananas and liquor. I like to use my slicer in the mid morning when the sun is just peeking Into my kitchen windows ,after my coffee ,before my lunch....I peel a banana, slice it in one easy push down of the tool, then I think...self? what should I do with these even, yellow slices? Then I brainstorm ways to use the slices in sandwiches, smoothies, rice cakes, on toast, in cereal,in oats, in my foster or in the freezer for later days. It's endless.I don't have a pet monkey but this slicer has opened my mind to the idea.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30JIF1DJ7MOPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30JIF1DJ7MOPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Buddha:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I remember, back in the day, we were issued a military model of the Hutzler that was olive drab, not yellow. In addition to slicing bananas, it could be used to prepare that nasty bully beef loaf in our rations.I can picture it clearly, as if it were just yesterday...There we were, anxiously waiting in the rain and mud for the signal to advance into no man's land.  Through the coils of barbed wire and across the field pocked with water-filled shell holes, we could barely see our objective - the enemy trenches.  Up and down the line, the order was relayed: "Fix....Hutzlers!"  Almost as one, we snapped our slicers onto the lugs below the barrels of our Enfields, and waited.  That was the worst time...waiting...some of us praying.There! The sound of the whistles and we were over the top, scrambling like rats to get through the wire and across that wretched field!  Somewhere off to the left a Maxim started chattering, and soon it was joined by the distinctive snap of Mannlicher rounds.  On we ran, fighting the muddy footing, cursing, screaming, slipping, closing...always closing...and then we were on them!Words cannot describe the effect our Hutzlers had upon the Hun.  I...I cannot speak of it plainly, even today, for it brings a cold pain to my chest.  See? Now my hands are trembling to think of that day...the look on their faces. But, for those of us who survived the crossing, the Huntzler proved to be the turning point, the edge that broke the stalemate along the front and ultimately led to the Armistice.There are few of us left today who remember that time.  We gather once a year to reminisce and perform a toast to those comrades who paid the ultimate price.  And we toast the Hutzler, for without it I am certain we all would have stayed in that god-forsaken muddy hell until it became our common grave.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5N7V9CWHMIJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5N7V9CWHMIJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Is this item legal to own in New York state? I know the Hutzler 571TA Tactical Assault Model is now illegal in Colorado and Connecticut, but I'm not sure about this one. If I'm not mistaken, New York is limiting total number of slices to 7, and the 571 produces a whopping EIGHTEEN SLICES !!! Who NEEDS 18 banana slices? Can you imagine the inherent danger involved with just having 18 slices available to one person at one time? What if they snapped and ate ALL OF THEM? I'm returning mine just to be on the safe side - I don't need the FDA SWAT Team kicking in my door at 3AM.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFAZZPJ87DNLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFAZZPJ87DNLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-New:LOCATION, 	-York:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Colorado:LOCATION, 	-Connecticut:LOCATION, 	-New:LOCATION, 	-York:LOCATION, 	-FDA:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I bought this for my wife and I'm so glad I did! I used to have her use a knife to slice bananas while I watched but sometimes the slices would be too thick and sometimes they would be too thin. Plus she would get carried away and slice it real quick like.That didn't work for me.Now I can watch her slice bananas all at once. Nice and slow. Slow slicing of a banana. With all the slices nice and even. Cut real slow. Nothing beats getting to tell her "Slice that banana, Baby. Slice it nice and slow."Now if only this company made an apple corer, I'd...I need some alone time.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J0AEHY5ENDLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J0AEHY5ENDLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I am, at long last, the proud owner of a Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer, which my sweet daughter gave me in my Christmas stocking--along with pages and pages of the best reviews she printed up for me.  I have wanted a Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer ever since my daughter found the reviews for it on Amazon a few years ago and read them aloud to me while I was driving.  Of course, I nearly ran off the road several times, I was laughing so hard, but we made it safely in the end without getting pulled over.  Although, if we had been, all we would have needed to do was to read a couple reviews to the cop.  I think he would have forgiven us!  Ever since then, I have wanted my very own 571B Banana Slicer--and now I have one!For Christmas brunch, my daughter-in-law asked me to make a fruit salad, and I was so excited to use my new Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer!  I made the salad the night before, but took the intact bananas, my 571B Banana Slicer, and the reviews along so that everyone could enjoy the process.  It was so much FUN slicing my bananas, although I do recommend removing all the stringy things BEFORE you slice.  It's really hard to pick little short sliced-up pieces of stringy stuff off of every slice!I have one suggestion for the Hutzler company:  You need to invent a 571B-B Banana Slicer for those who like thin slices.  These slices are awfully thick, especially for small children.  And trust me, it's REALLY HARD to slice a banana, then have to line the slices up right next to each other, move the Banana Slicer over half a slice--and slice a second time to get nice, thin slices.  You mostly end up with banana purée, which is nice if you're feeding a baby or a really old person, but not so nice for a fancy Christmas fruit salad.One more suggestion for Amazon--MAKE A BOOK OF THE REVIEWS OF THE HUTZLER 571B BANANA SLICER!  I would buy one for every single person in my family--and there are lots of us!I'm attaching photos of me proudly slicing my first banana, as well as the fruit salad with those lovely, perfect little slices of banana.  I foresee a future full of banana cream pies, banana pudding, banana-topped fruit salad, sliced bananas on peanut butter sandwiches, Bananas Foster . . .</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF7QY2Q22URKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF7QY2Q22URKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">It was a dark and stormy night, the lights kept blinking off and on with each bolt of lightning. The house was moaning and groaning with every ghostly gust of wind, the rain sounding like bullets hitting the windows.  I was frozen in place with fear worried that I would not be able to see the banana that I was about to slice.  Goodness knows I had hard enough time trying to get the milk into my bowl of cereal, the only thing that helped me was the familiar sound of the snap, crackle, and pop.  I was a little more than scared I would either not be able to find the kinfe to slice it with, or even worse that once found, I would drop that ever so sharp object on the cat and put a deep gash into her lovely fur and skin.All of a sudden I reached into the drawer, and there it was, my beautiful and ever so helpful Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  What a stroke of good fortune.  I could feel my fear being replaced by the calm and clear feelings of sccurity, knowing that all will be well in the world.  I felt safe.  I could have my cereal with perfectly sliced bananas and finally completely forgot about the storm outside and the screams for help from my neighbors.  This banana slicer saved my life.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R245LTU7MEDJLX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R245LTU7MEDJLX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is a godsend!!  As a proud owner of model nos. 1-570, I NEEDED to see what the 571 was all about.  Standing in line overnight in the wind and weather at the Hutzler Banana Slicer flagship store in midtown to be one of first to get the 571 was well worth it--thunder snow be damned!  I wasn't disappointed when I got the 571 home.  It sliced bananas in exactly the same way the other 570 models before it, but it did it with a style, dare I say an "attitude," that was altogether different.  You'll marvel at the sleek styling, the sexy lines, and bend-me-over-and-call-me-rover daring do of this innovative, modem marvel.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROWMXEB3F6UMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROWMXEB3F6UMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:ORGANIZATION, 	-Banana:ORGANIZATION, 	-Slicer:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">The Hutzlet 571 Banana Slicer is the greatest invention since sliced bread!The only issue I have with it is that it only works on bananas that curve to the right. You guys need to come up with one that slices bananas that curve to the left!!!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROV2ED0CL8UNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROV2ED0CL8UNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I was very disappointed with this item.  The description says it is "great for cereal" but I struggled for hours trying to slice my cereal.  I tried all sorts of cereals, most were too small and simply slotted through the gaps whilst others were either too hard or too crumbly.  It doesn't slice the flake type of cereal at all well and you may as well forget about "in bowl" slicing altogether.  The banana shape is quite restrictive too, it's probably only any good for slicing bananas and not cereal as the ad. suggests.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37PU69JLZ94QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37PU69JLZ94QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">Buyer Beware! The 571B banana slicer requires a patch to be installed PRIOR to first use with a Windows 8 platform.After several calls with the Hutzler tech support team, I was directed to a link on the Hutzler website. I was able to download the "Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais)." It is 349mb so it took a while to download, but I was able to save it on my desktop for easy locating. I was then able to work with the fruit department tech team and jotted down some notes.Instructions:1) Go to the "start" menu and search for "config.sys" file.2) In a SEPARATE search window, manually browse your desktop for the "Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais)"3) Double click the patch file icon, when it opens, click "disable autorun," then close the file.4) Going back to the patch file icon, RIGHT CLICK the icon and select "open with"5) Open with the notepad application.6) Scroll to line 371 and highlight lines 371 - 1114. Right mouse click and select "Copy"7) Going back to config.sys file opened in step 1, open in "basic editor."8) When the configuration file opens, disable (ignore button) the two warning screens that pop up.9) Scroll to line 22453, and type (rem) in front of the first semicolon BUT BEFORE the \\ signs. (This is CRITICAL as this line must be remmed out for the 571b to perform the "fruit alignment" rendering procedure required on all Hutzler banana slicers since the release of the Hutzler 300 series banana slicer. (EXCEPT 314a-d and any of the "M300" series military use field banana slicing units.)10) Scroll to line 14234, add a line and hit paste; this will add lines 371 - 1114 of the patch code.11) Hit close, then "save edits."12) Re-open the patch file icon. Enable autorun. Close patch file.13) Re-open the patch file.14) After 20 or 30 seconds (while autorunning) a message window will appear with the message "Hutzler 571b now installed."15) Select "set default actions".16) Click "autodetect left/right fruit polarity" (this will be a HUGE timesaver later, allowing for left/right handed fruit processing WITHOUT having to purchase the Hutzler 571C or utilizing the rug-drop technique mentioned in previous reviews.(FINALLY!!!!))17) Click "enable onboard camera use"; when the yellow warning window opens click "allow." (You may have to disable any Norton software you have running at this point and retry; check the YouTube video.)18) Click "save autodetect state", then click save configuration state. (You can create a backup file at this point if you wish, I recommend this if you are planning to clone this drive or migrate this file to additional 571b banana slicing machines.)19) Re-boot machine.Its just that simple! You are now ready to use your Hutzler 571B banana slicer on a Windows 8 platform for both left and right hand polarity bananas! ENJOY!Note: The above instructions are intended for use on 64bit machines only! If you are using a 32bit machine, you may have to add a re-routing line to the Hutzler 571b process redirector applet located in your Start-Up folder, but that should be obvious!!!)</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RKGAVQ7XV85R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RKGAVQ7XV85R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Norton:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">Before I purchased the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer, I was struggling with depression. You name the pill, I was probably on it. I was basically walking around life high as a kite on anti-depressants. Life was hard.You see, as a young child my mother never taught me how to slice a banana. I had to just ... eat the banana AS IS. This was very difficult for me. All my friends were eating peanut butter and sliced banana sandwiches, having fruit salad with sliced banana, simply enjoying the fruits of the sliced banana. I was living ignorantly in a world where everyone sliced bananas. I was constantly teased about eating bananas whole. I often went home and cried myself to sleep over the scrutiny of everyone around me. As a result, I grew a fear of the banana. I was diagnosed as having Bananaphobia. This is a highly researched phobia, and is basically unable to be cured. I hid myself from the world most of my teenage life due to Bananaphobia. I felt ... undesirable and lost.This continued until about 2 weeks, 3 hours and 57 minutes ago, when I purchased the Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer in attempt to feel better about myself. LET ME TELL YOU ...I am forever a changed woman. Now I hold my head high in confidence! I walk into a room and basically demand attention. I have never felt more beautiful in my life. I was changed that day ... and for the best I tell you, the BEST! Everyday I go to work, eating my sliced bananas, and I can tell people think I'm awesome. I see them out of the corner of my eyes ... just staring at me in pure envy, wishing they too, had a perfectly sliced banana. One man even thought I was so awesome, he proposed to me!! I don't know much about him ... but I knew he had good taste ... sooooo ... I married him! Together we eat sliced bananas, and dare people to taunt us. So, THANK YOU Victorio Kitchen Products 571B Banana Slicer .. THANK YOU for making my life complete and finding me true love!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28UVJ7VHSBBZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28UVJ7VHSBBZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Bananaphobia:LOCATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>

<p>Review: <span style="color: LightGreen;">I've been using the original 571A for years. All but two of the little cutting arms have broken off, but it still works! When I saw they had upgraded to the 571B (now in Yellow). I must admit I was skeptical, really skeptical!!! "How could they improve on the venerable old reliable 571A", I said. Of course, My wife was convinced right away, and insisted we use our Tax Refund (Thanks Uncle Sam) to purchase the New and Improved 571B. (now in Canary Yellow, with a slight tinge of Lemon Yellow, It's really a perfect Yellow, if you ask me!)After weeks of struggling, going back and forth, weighing the Pro's and Con's, I finally said "What the H"(I'd never say Hell). I threw caution to the wind and ordered one! It came in two days with Amazon Prime! We tracked the UPS drivers route on our computer all the way to delivery. I even made a special trip to Costco to buy extra bananas. It finally arrived, we opened the package, and there it was, all Yellow and wonderful! We used it right away and we were in slicing heaven. I only wish I had pulled the trigger and bought the upgraded version years ago, it's that good!. All those technological improvements over the 571A, plus it now comes in that great Lemon/Canary Yellow, how cool is that? All I can say is wow, wow, and Wow!!! It's been a total game changer in our house! If money is no object or if you are on a budget, Get the new 571B! You will thank yourself many times over...... at least until 2017 when the new, new 571C comes out.....I can't wait!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29PMLADDY6GC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29PMLADDY6GC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Sam:PERSON, 	-Canary:LOCATION, 	-Yellow:LOCATION, 	-Amazon:LOCATION, 	-UPS:ORGANIZATION, 	-Costco:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">For those of you like me who are getting ready for the Zombie Apocalypse, this is a MUST HAVE tool! I had already packed my survival bags when I came across this item and I just couldn't pass it up. When food supplies are low this 571B tool will help you divide bananas equally so no one feels like they are getting ripped off (which could lead to fights and cause noise that could attract zombies). THIS PRODUCT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE!The only downside that I've found (which on it's behalf is rather amazing) is I lost it yesterday and was searching my whole house trying to find it. I tore through the kitchen drawers and looked everywhere. Then sadly looking at the bananas I realized I'd never be able to slice again, I saw it. Snuggled warmly between two juicy bananas. Great camo 571B, great camo.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMJJUX3YJF2UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMJJUX3YJF2UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: red;">I remember, back in the day, we were issued a military model of the Hutzler that was olive drab, not yellow. In addition to slicing bananas, it could be used to prepare that nasty bully beef loaf in our rations.I can picture it clearly, as if it were just yesterday...There we were, anxiously waiting in the rain and mud for the signal to advance into no man's land.  Through the coils of barbed wire and across the field pocked with water-filled shell holes, we could barely see our objective - the enemy trenches.  Up and down the line, the order was relayed: "Fix....Hutzlers!"  Almost as one, we snapped our slicers onto the lugs below the barrels of our Enfields, and waited.  That was the worst time...waiting...some of us praying.There! The sound of the whistles and we were over the top, scrambling like rats to get through the wire and across that wretched field!  Somewhere off to the left a Maxim started chattering, and soon it was joined by the distinctive snap of Mannlicher rounds.  On we ran, fighting the muddy footing, cursing, screaming, slipping, closing...always closing...and then we were on them!Words cannot describe the effect our Hutzlers had upon the Hun.  I...I cannot speak of it plainly, even today, for it brings a cold pain to my chest.  See? Now my hands are trembling to think of that day...the look on their faces. But, for those of us who survived the crossing, the Huntzler proved to be the turning point, the edge that broke the stalemate along the front and ultimately led to the Armistice.There are few of us left today who remember that time.  We gather once a year to reminisce and perform a toast to those comrades who paid the ultimate price.  And we toast the Hutzler, for without it I am certain we all would have stayed in that god-forsaken muddy hell until it became our common grave.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5N7V9CWHMIJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5N7V9CWHMIJB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">I tried this on several bananas and had dismal results each time. Was about to throw it away when I realized that the banana slicer was shaped like a banana. I had been grasping bananas and pushing them through the device end first and was getting strange shaved banana pieces that were long and somewhat oval shaped, but varying widely in shape and size.  Then I noticed that the slicer housing was in a rough shape of a banana.  I had an epiphany and decided to try laying the skinned banana on the slicer so that its shape was congruent with the shape of the slicer and then pushing the banana "sideways" (vs. endwise) through the slicer.  This worked so much better and produced the nice, circular, cross-sectional slices that I was hoping to get.Ends up that this is a great product, but the lack of clear instructions led to wasting several bunches of bananas before figuring it on my own.  To help others avoid the same frustration I experienced, I decided to write down clear, easy to understand instructions:1. Remove the skin from the banana (I went through several bananas before realize that this didn't peel and slice)2. Lay the Slicer on a clean, planar, solid surface that is oriented so that a vector orthogonal to plane's surface is parallel to the local gravity vector.3. Lay the freshly peeled banana congruently, and in an analogue position, on the slicer surface that is on the antipodal side to the surface adjacent to aforementioned horizontal surfaceIMPORTANT!!!!! - ensure that the curve in the peeled banana lies in a parallel plane to the curve in the slicer.4. While holding the banana using several fingers placed along the apex ridge line of the banana, carefully pull the slicer upward  and parallel to a vector that is perpendicular to the aforementioned horizontal surface. Make sure that this motion is a pure translation without any measurable rotational components.  Apply pressure against the banana so that it remains inertial during the motion of the slicer.Following these simple instructions will ensure that your banana slicing efforts are immediately successful.</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZCZOKP6N5X8Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZCZOKP6N5X8Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
<p>Review: <span style="color: black;">After having wasted millions on inferior banana slicers, I realized that the average over-the-counter slicers are useless on most of the 739 cultivated varieties of the cylindrical yellow fruit.  That's why I'm delighted to endorse the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!  I've yet to find a type it couldn't slice with ease.  The Hutzler performed beautifully on the fruit I bought in Cuba (the Havana banana), the banana from Georgia (the Savannah banana), and the sucker I bought in Missoula from a washed-up teen idol (the Hanna Montana banana).  It provided uniform slices when used on the petrified specimen from Ricky Ricardo's old nightclub (the Tropicana banana), as well as fruit grown in the flood plain of the serpentine Pennsylvania river (the Susquehanna banana).  Say goodbye to blisters caused by slicing fruit now that the Hutzler 571 is available from Amazon (with a doctor's prescription).  All I can say is, this is a great time to be alive and be slicing bananas!</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RISUUH3GSFGPP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII">, https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RISUUH3GSFGPP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047E0EII</a>, Named entities: [	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Cuba:LOCATION, 	-Havana:LOCATION, 	-Georgia:LOCATION, 	-Missoula:LOCATION, 	-Hanna:LOCATION, 	-Montana:LOCATION, 	-Ricky:PERSON, 	-Ricardo:PERSON, 	-Tropicana:LOCATION, 	-Pennsylvania:LOCATION, 	-Susquehanna:LOCATION, 	-Hutzler:PERSON, 	-Amazon:ORGANIZATION], <b>This review is NOT sarcastic</b><hr size="10"><br></p>
